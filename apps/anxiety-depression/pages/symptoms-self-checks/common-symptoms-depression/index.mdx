# Common Symptoms of Depression

Depression is much more than feeling sad for a day or two. It's a persistent change in mood, energy, and how you experience life that lasts for weeks or months. It affects your emotions, thoughts, behavior, and physical health.

## Core Emotional Symptoms

**Persistent Sadness or Empty Feeling**
- Feeling "down," empty, or numb most of the day, nearly every day
- The sadness doesn't go away even when good things happen
- You may cry for no clear reason, or feel like you want to but can't

**Loss of Interest or Pleasure (Anhedonia)**
- Activities you used to enjoy feel pointless or boring
- Food doesn't taste as good
- You no longer look forward to things
- Example: A musician who loses interest in playing, or a parent who doesn't enjoy time with their children

**Feelings of Worthlessness or Excessive Guilt**
- Harsh self-criticism or self-blame
- Feeling like a burden to others

## How Depression Severity Is Assessed
