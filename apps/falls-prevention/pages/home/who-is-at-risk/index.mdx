While anyone can fall, certain factors increase your chances. Understanding your personal risk helps you target the right prevention strategies.

## Age and Fall Risk

**Age 65-74**: About 1 in 4 adults in this age group fall each year

**Age 75 and older**: Fall risk increases to nearly 1 in 3

However, age alone doesn't cause falls. It's the changes that sometimes come with age that matter.

## Medical Conditions That Increase Risk

### Balance and Movement Disorders
- Parkinson's disease
- Stroke or history of stroke
- Multiple sclerosis
- Arthritis that affects joints

### Chronic Health Issues
- Diabetes (especially if it causes nerve damage in feet)
- Heart disease or irregular heartbeats
- Thyroid problems
- Low blood pressure when standing

### Sensory Problems
- Poor vision or uncorrected vision changes
- Hearing loss (affects balance)
- Numbness in feet or legs

## Lifestyle and Behavior Factors

You may be at higher risk if you:
- Have fallen before (doubles your chance of falling again)
- Limit physical activity or exercise
- Live alone (help isn't immediately available)
- Have recently been hospitalized
- Use a walker or cane improperly

## Medications

Taking certain medications increases fall risk:
- **4 or more medications**: Any combination increases risk
- Blood pressure medicines
- Sedatives or sleeping pills
- Antidepressants
- Pain medications (especially opioids)

**Note**: Don't stop medications on your own. Talk with your doctor about safer alternatives.

## Physical Weakness

Signs of weakness that increase fall risk:
- Difficulty getting up from a chair without using arms
- Trouble walking or feeling unsteady
- Needing to hold onto furniture when walking
- Taking small, shuffling steps

## Women vs. Men

- **Women** fall more often than men
- **Men** are more likely to die from fall-related injuries
- Both genders benefit equally from prevention programs

## Multiple Risk Factors

Having one risk factor doesn't mean you'll fall. Most falls happen when several factors combine. The good news: you can modify many of these risks.

## What You Can Do

- Get a fall risk assessment from your healthcare provider
- Review this list honestly - which factors apply to you?
- Focus on modifiable risks (later lessons show you how)
- Don't let risk factors cause fear - let them motivate action

## Remember

Higher risk doesn't mean falls are inevitable. Identifying your personal risk factors is the first step toward targeted prevention.
