# What to Expect Week by Week After Starting Medication

Here's a typical timeline for antidepressants.

## Week 1-2
- **Side Effects May Start**: Nausea, headache, or increased anxiety
- **No Mood Improvement Yet**: This is normal
- **What to Do**: Stick with it. Most side effects fade after the first week

## Week 3-4
- **Side Effects Decrease**: You should start to adjust
- **Early Improvements**: You may notice better sleep or slightly more energy
- **Mood**: Still may not feel much better

## Week 5-8
- **Noticeable Improvement**: Mood, anxiety, and motivation should improve
- **Full Effect**: By week 6-8, you should feel the medication working
- **What to Do**: Keep tracking your symptoms

## Beyond 8 Weeks
If you don't feel better after 8 weeks at an adequate dose, talk to your doctor about:
- Increasing the dose
- Switching medications
- Adding therapy or another treatment
