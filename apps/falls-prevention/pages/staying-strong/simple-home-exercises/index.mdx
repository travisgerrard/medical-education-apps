# Simple Home Exercises

You don't need a gym or special equipment to build the strength and balance that prevent falls. These simple exercises can be done at home with just a sturdy chair and counter for support.

## Before You Start

**Safety reminders:**
- Clear space around you
- Wear non-slip shoes or bare feet
- Have stable support nearby
- Start with easier versions
- Stop if you feel pain, dizzy, or short of breath

**How often:**
- 20-30 minutes
- 3-4 times per week
- At least 48 hours between strength sessions

**Warm-up first:** 5 minutes of gentle movement (marching in place, arm circles)

## Strength Exercises

### 1. Chair Stands (Most Important)

**Why**: Mimics standing from toilet, getting out of car

**How to do it:**
1. Sit in sturdy armless chair
2. Feet flat on floor, hip-width apart
3. Cross arms over chest
4. Lean slightly forward
5. Stand up without using hands

**Goal**: 10-15 repetitions, 2-3 sets

**Easier**: Use arms to push off
**Harder**: Hold position halfway up for 3 seconds

### 2. Wall Push-Ups

**Why**: Upper body strength for catching yourself

**How to do it:**
1. Stand arm's length from wall
2. Place palms on wall at shoulder height

4. Push back to starting position

**Goal**: 10-15 repetitions, 2 sets

**Easier**: Stand closer to wall

### 3. Calf Raises

**Why**: Ankle strength for balance and walking

**How to do it:**
1. Stand behind sturdy chair, holding for balance

**Goal**: Hold 10+ seconds each leg

**Progress**: Hold longer, lift knee higher, less support

### 9. Heel-to-Toe Walk

**Why**: Dynamic balance, like walking on a beam

**How to do it:**
1. Walk down hallway

## Progression Guide

**Week 1-2:**
- Learn movements
- Use maximum support
- 1 set of each
- Rest as needed

**Week 3-4:**
- Add second set
- Reduce support slightly
- Increase repetitions to 10-12

**Week 5-8:**
- 2-3 sets
- Less support
- 12-15 repetitions
- Add harder variations

**Week 9+:**
- Maintain or continue progressing
- Try advanced versions
- Challenge yourself safely

## Using Resistance Bands

**Adds challenge to:**
- Leg raises (loop around ankles)
- Arm exercises
- Seated rows

**Cost**: $10-20 for set
**Advantage**: Progressive resistance

## Tracking Your Progress

**Keep a log:**
- Date
- Exercises done
- Reps and sets
- How you felt
- Modifications used

**Signs of improvement:**
- Exercises feel easier
- Can do more repetitions
- Need less support
- Better balance in daily life

## Common Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Hold your breath (breathe normally)
- Rush through movements (slow and controlled)
- Push through pain (discomfort OK, pain NO)
- Skip rest days (muscles need recovery)
- Give up after one week (takes 6+ weeks for benefits)

## When to Advance

**You're ready for harder versions when:**
- Current version feels easy
- Can complete all reps with good form
- No excessive fatigue
- Feeling confident

## If Exercises Are Too Hard

**Modifications:**
- Use more support
- Smaller range of motion
- Fewer repetitions
- More rest between sets
- Seated versions

**Don't give up—start where you are.**

## Working with Pain

**Joint pain:**
- Modify range of motion
- Try different exercise
- Consider water exercise

**Muscle soreness:**
- Normal after new exercise
- Should decrease in 2-3 days
- Different from injury pain

**When to stop:**
- Sharp pain
- Chest pain or severe shortness of breath
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Any concerning symptom

## Remember

These exercises are specifically designed to prevent falls. They're not just "staying active"—they're targeted training.

Consistency is more important than intensity. Doing these exercises 3 times per week for 20 minutes is far better than one intense hour-long session.

You won't see dramatic changes overnight. Stick with it for 6-8 weeks and you'll notice real improvement in strength, balance, and confidence.

Every repetition you do is one step toward preventing a fall and maintaining your independence.
