## Remember

Calling your doctor after a fall isn't being overly cautious—it's being smart. Many serious problems start with "minor" falls.

Your doctor needs to know about falls to help you. Don't minimize or hide them out of embarrassment or fear.

Falls are medical events, not personal failures. They require the same attention as chest pain or high blood sugar.

Every fall is information that can help prevent the next one. Use it as an opportunity to improve your safety.
