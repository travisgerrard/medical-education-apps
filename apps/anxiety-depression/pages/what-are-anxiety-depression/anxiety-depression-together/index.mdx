# Anxiety and Depression Together

![Two colored ribbons weaving together](/images/together_knot.png)

It is very common to have both anxiety and depression at the same time. In fact, about half of people diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

## Why They Overlap

The biological mechanisms for anxiety and depression are similar. They involve the same neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine.

## Shared Symptoms
- Sleep problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Fatigue
- Irritability

## Treating Both

Because they are so closely linked, treatments often overlap.
- **Medications**: Antidepressants (medications that increase brain chemicals like serotonin) are effective for both conditions.
- **Therapy**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) works well for both.

> Treating one condition often helps the other. Your care plan will likely address both simultaneously.
