# Sleep Routines and Light Exposure

Sleep problems are both a symptom and a cause of anxiety and depression. Improving your sleep is one of the most effective ways to improve your mood.

## Why Sleep Matters

- **Emotional Regulation**: A tired brain is more reactive to stress and negative emotions.
- **Memory Consolidation**: Sleep helps process the day's events and emotions.
- **Physical Repair**: Your body heals and restores energy during sleep.

## The "Big Three" of Sleep Hygiene

### 1. Consistency is King
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day—even on weekends.
- **Why**: This trains your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm).
- **Tip**: If you sleep poorly one night, still get up at your normal time. Napping or sleeping in will only make it harder to sleep the next night.

### 2. Light Exposure
Light is the strongest signal to your brain about when to be awake and when to sleep.
- **Morning**: Get 15-30 minutes of bright light (ideally sunlight) within an hour of waking up. This anchors your circadian rhythm and boosts mood.
- **Evening**: Dim the lights 2 hours before bed. Avoid bright overhead lights.
- **Screens**: Blue light from phones/laptops suppresses melatonin (the sleep hormone). Stop using screens 1-2 hours before bed, or use "Night Shift" mode and blue-light blocking glasses.

### 3. Stimulus Control (The 20-Minute Rule)
If you can't sleep, **don't stay in bed**.
- If you've been awake for about 20 minutes (don't watch the clock, just estimate), get up.
- Go to another room and do something quiet and boring (read a book, listen to soft music, fold laundry).
- **Do not** look at screens or do anything energizing.
- Return to bed only when you feel sleepy (eyes heavy, nodding off).
- **Why**: You want your brain to associate the bed with *sleep*, not with tossing and turning.

## Creating a Wind-Down Routine

Your brain needs a signal that the day is over. Create a 30-60 minute buffer zone before bed:
1.  **Disconnect**: Put the phone away.
2.  **Relax**: Take a warm shower, stretch, or practice breathing exercises.
3.  **Prepare**: Set out clothes for tomorrow or make a to-do list (to get worries out of your head).

## Environment Checklist

- **Temperature**: Cool is best (65-68°F / 18-20°C).
- **Darkness**: Use blackout curtains or an eye mask. Even small lights (like standby LEDs) can disrupt sleep.
- **Noise**: Use earplugs or a white noise machine/fan to block disruptive sounds.
- **Bed**: Use your bed *only* for sleep and sex. No working, eating, or watching TV in bed.

## Dealing with "Sleep Anxiety"

If you dread going to bed because you worry about not sleeping:
- **Acceptance**: Remind yourself, "Rest is good, even if I don't sleep perfectly."
- **Cognitive Shuffling**: Visualize random objects (a cow, a toaster, a balloon) to distract your brain from worrying.
- **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This physically calms your nervous system.
