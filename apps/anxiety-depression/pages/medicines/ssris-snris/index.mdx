# SSRIs and SNRIs

These are the most commonly prescribed medications for anxiety and depression.

## SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)
SSRIs increase serotonin levels in the brain.

**Common SSRIs:**
- Fluoxetine (Prozac)
- Sertraline (Zoloft)
- Escitalopram (Lexapro)
- Citalopram (Celexa)
- Paroxetine (Paxil)

## SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)
SNRIs increase both serotonin and norepinephrine.

**Common SNRIs:**
- Venlafaxine (Effexor)
- Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
- Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)

## How They Compare
- SSRIs are usually the first choice because they have fewer side effects
- SNRIs may be better if you also have chronic pain or fatigue

> [!NOTE]
> All these medications are equally effective for most people. The "best" one is the one that works for you with the fewest side effects.
