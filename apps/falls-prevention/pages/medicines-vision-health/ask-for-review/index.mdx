## Remember

Fall risk assessment isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing process. Your risk changes with new conditions, medications, and life circumstances.

Don't wait for a fall to request evaluation. Proactive assessment can prevent falls before they happen.

You know your body best. If something feels "off," trust that instinct and request assessment.

Fall prevention is a team effort, but you're the team captain. Advocate for yourself and ask for the help you need.
