# Safer Bathroom

The bathroom is the single most dangerous room in your home for falls. Wet surfaces, hard fixtures, and awkward movements create a perfect storm of fall risk. Making your bathroom safer is the highest-priority home modification.

## Why Bathrooms Are So Dangerous

**Statistics:**
- **80% of bathroom falls** result in injuries
- Most common injuries: hip fractures, head trauma
- Combination of hard surfaces + water = extreme risk

**Risk factors:**
- Wet, slippery floors and tub/shower
- Getting in/out of tub or shower
- Reaching, bending, and turning
- Standing on one leg (drying feet, putting on pants)
- Nighttime bathroom trips when sleepy

## Essential Bathroom Safety Features

### 1. Grab Bars (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Critical locations:**
- **Inside shower/tub** (at least 2 bars)
- **Next to toilet** (one or both sides)
- **Outside tub** for entering/exiting

**Proper installation:**
- Must support 250-300 pounds
- Attach to wall studs, NOT drywall alone
- Professional installation strongly recommended
- Test stability before relying on them

**Positioning:**
- 33-36 inches high (grab at body height)
- Horizontal for most uses
- Vertical bars help with standing
- Angled bars (45 degrees) offer flexibility

**Cost**: $15-40 per bar + $50-100 installation each

**DO NOT use towel bars or soap dishes for support—they will pull out of the wall!**

### 2. Non-Slip Surfaces

**Tub and Shower:**
- Adhesive non-slip strips or decals
- Textured rubber mat with suction cups
- Replace mat when suction weakens
- Clean regularly (soap buildup reduces grip)

**Bathroom Floor:**
- Remove ALL bath mats and rugs
- If you must have a mat:
  - Use only rubber-backed, non-slip
  - Ensure it lies completely flat
  - Better option: Remove entirely

### 3. Shower/Tub Modifications

**Stepping over tub edge is extremely risky.**

**Solutions:**
- **Transfer bench**: Sit, swing legs over ($40-80)
- **Tub cut**: Remove section of tub wall ($500-1,000)
- **Walk-in shower**: Convert tub to curbless shower ($3,000-8,000)
- **Walk-in tub**: Door in tub side ($3,000-10,000)

**Hand-held shower head:**
- Shower while seated
- Better control
- Reduces need to move around wet tub
- Cost: $20-100

**Shower chair or bench:**
- Sit while showering
- Eliminates balance requirements
- Reduces fatigue
- Cost: $30-150

## Toilet Safety

### Height Matters

**Problem**: Standard toilets are too low (causes strain getting up)

**Solutions:**
- **Raised toilet seat**: Adds 3-6 inches ($25-60)
- **Toilet safety frame**: Armrests for support ($40-100)
- **Comfort height toilet**: 17-19 inches high ($200-400 + installation)

**Getting up from toilet:**
- Use grab bars or safety frame
- Never pull on sink or toilet paper holder
- Scoot forward before standing
- Take your time

## Sink Area Safety

**Stability:**
- Never lean on sink for support (can break free from wall)
- Install grab bar near sink if needed
- Use wall for balance, not fixtures

**Storage:**
- Keep daily items at easy reach
- Avoid bending for items under sink
- Use lazy Susan for corner cabinet access

**Footwear:**
- Never barefoot in bathroom
- Keep non-slip slippers just outside door
- Put on slippers BEFORE entering bathroom

## Lighting (Critical for Bathroom)

**Requirements:**
- Brightest lights in your home
- Light switch outside bathroom door
- Nightlight for nighttime use
- No shadows in tub/shower

**Best options:**
- Bright LED lighting (100+ watts equivalent)
- Motion-sensor nightlight for nighttime
- Leave light on at night (uses minimal electricity)

## Nighttime Bathroom Safety

**High-risk time:**
- Sleepy and less coordinated
- Tend to rush
- Eyes not adjusted to light
- May be taking nighttime medications

**Prevention:**
- Motion-sensor nightlights along path
- Keep bathroom light on or very bright nightlight
- Bedside commode if distance/frequency is issue
- Limit evening fluids if nighttime trips are frequent

## Door and Layout

**Door considerations:**
- Should open outward (in case you fall, door isn't blocked)
- Remove locks or use privacy lock that can be opened from outside
- Ensure doorway is wide enough for walker if used

**Floor space:**
- Remove unnecessary furniture
- Keep clear path to toilet and shower
- No rugs to trip over

## Bathing Safety Rules

**Before showering/bathing:**
- □ Gather all supplies within reach
- □ Ensure grab bars are secure
- □ Place non-slip mat in tub
- □ Adjust water temperature before entering
- □ Put on non-slip footwear

**During bathing:**
- □ Use grab bars when entering/exiting
- □ Sit on shower chair if available
- □ Take your time
- □ Don't lock the door
- □ Have phone nearby in case of emergency

**After bathing:**
- □ Dry off while seated if possible
- □ Use grab bars to stand and exit
- □ Wipe up water from floor
- □ Put on non-slip footwear immediately

## Emergency Preparedness

**If you live alone:**
- Don't lock bathroom door
- Keep phone within reach
- Consider medical alert device
- Tell family your bathing schedule
- Have plan if you fall in bathroom

**Can't get up after fall:**
- Don't panic
- Call for help (phone or medical alert)
- Stay warm (grab towel)
- Don't try to stand if injured

## Budget-Friendly Safety Improvements

**Under $50:**
- Adhesive non-slip strips for tub ($10)
- Suction-cup grab bar ($20-30)
- Raised toilet seat ($25-40)
- Non-slip bath mat ($15-25)
- Bright LED bulbs ($10-15)
- Motion-sensor nightlight ($10)

**$50-$200:**
- Installed grab bars (2-3 bars)
- Hand-held shower head ($30-80)
- Shower chair ($50-100)
- Toilet safety frame ($50-90)

**Worth the investment:**
Even if you need to spend $300-500 to make your bathroom completely safe, it's far less than the cost of a fall-related injury.

## When to Consider Major Modifications

**Consult with occupational therapist if you:**
- Have fallen in bathroom before
- Feel extremely unsafe showering
- Can't get in/out of tub
- Have significant mobility limitations
- Are planning to age in place

## Medicare and Insurance

**May cover:**
- Grab bar installation (sometimes)
- Durable medical equipment (shower chair, raised toilet seat)
- Must be deemed "medically necessary"
- Get doctor's prescription to improve chances

**Check with:**
- Medicare/Medicaid
- Private insurance
- Veterans benefits
- Area Agency on Aging

The most dangerous thing you can do is think "I'll be careful." Install physical safety features instead of relying on caution alone.
