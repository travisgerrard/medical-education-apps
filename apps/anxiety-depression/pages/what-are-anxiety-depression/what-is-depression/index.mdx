# What is Depression?

Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act.

## More Than Just Sadness

Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.

### Key Symptoms

- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
- Changes in appetite (weight loss or gain)
