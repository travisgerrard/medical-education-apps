# Tracking Progress and Staying Consistent

Consistency is more important than intensity.

## Track Your Exercise
- Use a simple calendar or app
- Mark days you exercise
- Note how you felt before and after
- Celebrate small wins

## Build the Habit
- Same time each day helps
- Link it to an existing habit (e.g., "After my morning coffee, I walk")
- Prepare the night before

## Stay Motivated
- Set realistic goals
- Find an exercise buddy
- Reward yourself (non-food rewards)
- Remember your "why"

> [!TIP]
> Missing a day doesn't mean failure. Just get back on track the next day.
