# Panic Attacks

A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear and physical discomfort that peaks within minutes. It triggers severe physical reactions even when there's no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be terrifying, especially the first time, but they are not dangerous.

## What It Feels Like

During a panic attack, you may experience several of these symptoms simultaneously:

**Cardiovascular Symptoms**
- **Racing or pounding heart** (palpitations)
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Feeling like your heart is going to explode

**Breathing Difficulties**
- Shortness of breath or feeling smothered
- Sensation of choking
- Hyperventilation (breathing too fast)

**Neurological Symptoms**
- Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint
- Trembling or shaking
- Numbness or tingling (especially in hands or face)

**Physical Sensations**
- Sweating or sudden chills
- Hot flashes or cold chills
- Nausea or stomach distress

**Psychological Symptoms**
- Intense fear of dying or "going crazy"
- Feeling of unreality (derealization)
- Feeling detached from yourself (depersonalization)
- Fear of losing control

## The Timeline of a Panic Attack

Understanding what to expect can make panic attacks less frightening:

**0-2 minutes**: Symptoms start suddenly and intensify rapidly
**2-10 minutes**: Symptoms peak - this is the worst part
**10-30 minutes**: Symptoms gradually decrease
**30+ minutes**: Most symptoms have subsided, but you may feel shaky or fatigued

Most panic attacks last 5-20 minutes, though the intense fear can make it feel much longer.

## Panic Attack vs. Heart Attack

Many people having their first panic attack think they're having a heart attack. Here are some differences:

**More Likely Panic Attack:**
- Sudden onset in minutes
- Peaks quickly then improves
- Sharp, stabbing chest pain
- Younger age (teens to 40s)
- Triggered by stress or anxiety
- Breathing exercises help

**More Likely Heart Heart**:
- Gradual onset over minutes
- Symptoms persist or worsen
- Pressure, squeezing, or heavy feeling
- Older age, risk factors present
- May occur during physical exertion
- Symptoms progress despite calming

**When in doubt, seek medical attention.** It's better to be checked and reassured than to ignore a potential heart problem.

## What To Do During a Panic Attack

These techniques can help you ride out the attack:

**1. Remind Yourself It's a Panic Attack**
- Tell yourself: "This is a panic attack. It will pass. I am not dying."
- Labeling what's happening can reduce fear

**2. Practice Grounding Techniques**
- **5-4-3-2-1 Method**: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
- Focus on physical sensations (feet on the ground, texture of an object)

**3. Control Your Breathing**
- **Box Breathing**: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4
- Breathe slowly through your nose
- Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly - focus on belly breathing

**4. Use a Safe Phrase**
- Repeat: "This is temporary. I am safe. This will pass."

**5. Stay Where You Are**
- Resist the urge to flee - this reinforces fear
- If possible, stay in the situation until panic decreases

## After a Panic Attack

It's normal to feel:
- Exhausted or drained
- Anxious about having another one
- Embarrassed if it happened in public
- Physically sore (from muscle tension)

Rest if you can, and practice self-compassion.

## When to Seek Help

See a healthcare provider if:
- You've had multiple panic attacks
- You worry constantly about having another attack
- You avoid places or activities for fear of panic
- Panic attacks are affecting your quality of life

Panic disorder (recurring, unexpected panic attacks) is very treatable with therapy and sometimes medication.

> Panic attacks are frightening but not dangerous. They typically peak within 10 minutes and then subside. Grounding techniques and slow breathing can help you ride them out.
