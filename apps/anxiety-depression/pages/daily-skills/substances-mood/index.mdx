# Alcohol, Cannabis, Caffeine, and Mood

![Balance scale with healthy habits vs substances](/images/substances_mood_balance.png)

What you put into your body has a direct effect on your brain chemistry. Many people use substances to cope with anxiety or depression ("self-medication"), but this often backfires and makes symptoms worse over time.

## Alcohol: The "Depressant"

Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. While it might briefly numb anxiety or sadness, it ultimately lowers serotonin and norepinephrine levels, worsening the very symptoms you're trying to escape.

### The "Rebound Effect"
- **Short-term**: Alcohol mimics GABA (a calming chemical), making you feel relaxed.
- **Long-term**: Your brain compensates by reducing its own GABA sensitivity and increasing glutamate (an excitatory chemical).
- **Result**: When the alcohol wears off, you feel *more* anxious and jittery than before. This is often called "hangxiety."

### Impact on Sleep
Alcohol might help you fall asleep faster, but it destroys **sleep quality**. It reduces REM sleep (essential for emotional processing) and causes you to wake up frequently.

### Interaction with Medication
Alcohol interferes with almost all antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, making them less effective or causing dangerous sedation.

**Recommendation**:
- **Best**: Avoid alcohol completely while recovering.
- **Moderate**: Limit to 1 drink/day for women, 2 for men.
- **Never** mix with benzodiazepines (Xanax, Ativan) or sleep aids.

## Cannabis (Marijuana)

The relationship between cannabis and mental health is complex.

### Anxiety
- **Low doses (CBD-dominant)**: May help reduce anxiety for some people.
- **High doses (THC-dominant)**: Can trigger panic attacks, paranoia, and increased heart rate.

### Depression
- Chronic, heavy use is linked to **worsening depression** and "amotivational syndrome" (lack of drive/interest).
- It can numb emotions, preventing you from doing the work needed to heal (like therapy or behavioral activation).

### Risks
- **Dependency**: About 10% of users develop cannabis use disorder.
- **Psychosis**: High-potency THC increases the risk of psychotic episodes in vulnerable individuals.

**Recommendation**: Be cautious. If you use it, track your mood. If you notice increased anxiety or lower motivation, take a break.

## Caffeine

Caffeine is a stimulant that triggers the "fight or flight" response—the exact same system that causes anxiety.

### The Anxiety Loop
1. You drink coffee to feel alert.
2. Caffeine increases heart rate and adrenaline.
3. Your anxious brain interprets these physical sensations as "danger."
4. You feel panic or dread.

### Sleep Disruption
Caffeine has a "half-life" of about 5-6 hours. If you drink a cup at 4 PM, half of it is still in your system at 10 PM, making it hard to reach deep sleep.

**Recommendation**:
- **If you have anxiety**: Consider cutting it out completely or switching to decaf/tea.
- **Limit**: No caffeine after 12:00 PM.
- **Taper slowly**: Quitting cold turkey causes headaches and irritability.

## Nicotine

Many people smoke or vape to "calm nerves," but nicotine is a stimulant. The "calm" you feel is actually just **withdrawal relief**.
- Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety.
- Smoking fixes the withdrawal, so you feel "better"—but you're just returning to baseline.
- Quitting can significantly lower anxiety levels after the initial withdrawal period.

## A Harm Reduction Approach

You don't have to be perfect. Small changes matter.

1.  **Track It**: Note how you feel *before*, *during*, and *the next day* after using a substance. Connect the dots.
2.  **Set Limits**: "I won't drink on weeknights" or "I'll switch to half-caf coffee."
3.  **Find Alternatives**: If you drink to relax, try tea, a hot bath, or a walk instead.

> **Honesty is key.** Tell your doctor or therapist about your substance use. They aren't there to judge you; they need to know to treat you safely.
