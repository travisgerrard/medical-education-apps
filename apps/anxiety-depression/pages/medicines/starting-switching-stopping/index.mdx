# Starting, Switching, and Stopping Medicines Safely

How you start and stop medication matters as much as which one you take.

## Starting
- **Start Low, Go Slow**: Your doctor will usually start with a low dose and increase gradually
- **Be Patient**: It takes 2-4 weeks to feel better, and up to 8 weeks for full effect
- **Track Symptoms**: Keep a journal of how you're feeling

## Switching
If your medication isn't working or causes too many side effects:
- **Don't Stop Abruptly**: Your doctor will create a plan to taper off the old medication while starting the new one
- **Give It Time**: The new medication also needs several weeks to work

## Stopping (Tapering)
Never stop antidepressants suddenly. This can cause withdrawal symptoms like:
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Mood swings
- Flu-like symptoms

Your doctor will create a gradual tapering schedule, usually reducing the dose slowly over several weeks.

> [!WARNING]
> Always work with your doctor when starting, switching, or stopping medication. Never adjust doses on your own.
