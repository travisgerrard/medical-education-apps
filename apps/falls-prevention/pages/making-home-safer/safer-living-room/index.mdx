# Safer Living Room and Bedroom

Your living room and bedroom are where you spend most of your time at home. Making these spaces safer reduces daily fall risk significantly.

## Living Room Safety

### Furniture Arrangement

**Clear pathways:**
- Create at least 3 feet of clear walking space
- Arrange furniture along walls when possible
- Remove unnecessary pieces
- Avoid having to walk around coffee tables

**Stable support:**
- Remove wheeled or rocking furniture from walking paths
- Ensure all furniture is sturdy enough to lean on if needed
- Avoid lightweight decorative pieces in high-traffic areas

### Floor Safety

**Eliminate trip hazards:**
- Remove ALL throw rugs and area rugs
  - If you must keep rugs, use non-slip backing AND tape edges down
  - Best option: Remove them entirely
- Secure electrical cords along baseboards
- Arrange furniture to avoid stretching cords across rooms
- Remove floor clutter daily

**Carpet considerations:**
- Low pile carpet is safer than thick, plush carpet
- Repair worn or loose carpet immediately
- Ensure transitions between rooms are smooth and visible

### Seating

**Chair safety:**
- Chair seats should be 17-19 inches high (knee height when standing)
- Chairs should have arms for pushing up
- Avoid low, soft sofas (hard to get out of)
- Test stability before using occasional chairs

### Storage and Accessibility

**Daily items:**
- Keep frequently used items at waist to shoulder height
- Avoid storing things on high shelves that require reaching
- Use reacher/grabber tools ($10-20) for dropped items
- Don't bend to pick things up if unsteady

**Remote controls and phones:**
- Keep within easy reach of seating
- Consider cordless phones in multiple rooms
- Large-button remotes are easier to use

### Entertainment Setup

**TV viewing:**
- Ensure TV is at appropriate height (eye level when seated)
- Avoid glare that could obscure obstacles
- Keep volume at level that doesn't startle you

### Windows and Blinds

**Cord management:**
- Keep window blind cords secured and out of walking paths
- Consider cordless blinds

## Bedroom Safety

### Bed Height

**Critical consideration:**
- When sitting on bed edge, feet should rest flat on floor
- Knees should be at 90-degree angle
- Too low: Hard to stand up
- Too high: Feet dangle, hard to get in

**Adjusting bed height:**
- Add bed risers (available at stores, $15-30)
- Remove casters to lower bed
- Consider adjustable bed frame

### Bedside Essentials

**Within arm's reach:**
- Lamp with easy-to-find switch
- Phone (preferably with large buttons)
- Glasses
- Glass of water
- Medications (if taken at night)

**Nightstand:**
- Stable and sturdy
- Right height (level with mattress top)
- Not cluttered
- Large enough for essentials

### Bedroom Flooring

**High-risk area:**
- Bedrooms have highest rate of nighttime falls
- Remove all rugs, especially beside bed
- Clear path from bed to bathroom
- No cords across walking path

**Footwear:**
- Keep non-slip slippers or shoes at bedside
- Never walk in socks alone
- Slip-on shoes easier than lace-ups for nighttime

### Lighting (Critical for Bedroom)

**Bedside lighting:**
- Lamp switch should be reachable from bed
- Consider touch lamps or voice-activated lights
- Keep flashlight at bedside for power outages

**Path to bathroom:**
- Motion-sensor nightlights in outlet along path
- Leave bathroom light on or use nightlight
- Consider smart lights you can turn on from bed

### Closets and Dressers

**Clothing storage:**
- Daily-wear clothes at easy-to-reach heights
- Avoid reaching overhead or bending low
- Use closet organizers to bring items forward
- Consider a dressing chair for putting on clothes

**Getting dressed:**
- Sit down to put on pants and shoes
- Use sock aids and long-handled shoehorns
- Lay out clothes the night before

## Hallways

### Clear passage:
- Remove decorative tables or narrow stands
- Keep walls clear of protruding items
- Ensure adequate width (minimum 36 inches)

### Lighting:
- Bright overhead lights
- Night lights every 10-15 feet
- Light switches at both ends of hall
- Motion sensors for nighttime

## Simple Equipment That Helps

### For living room:
- Reacher/grabber tool ($10-20)
- Furniture risers for low chairs ($15-25)
- Cord organizers ($5-10)

### For bedroom:
- Bed rails for assistance ($30-50)
- Bed stick or pole for leverage ($40-60)
- Touch lamps ($15-30)
- Motion sensor nightlights ($10-15 each)

## Quick Safety Checklist

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't** keep decorative rugs "because they're pretty"—safety over aesthetics
2. **Don't** use extension cords permanently—install additional outlets
3. **Don't** store daily items in hard-to-reach places
4. **Don't** walk around in dim lighting to "save electricity"
5. **Don't** ignore small hazards thinking "I know they're there"

## Remember

You move through your living room and bedroom multiple times daily. Making these spaces completely safe eliminates hundreds of fall opportunities every week.

The changes may feel unfamiliar at first, but safety and independence are worth the adjustment.
