# How Long Therapy Takes

The length of therapy varies depending on your needs and goals.

## Short-Term vs. Long-Term
- **Short-Term (12-20 sessions)**: Often used for CBT to address specific symptoms or problems.
- **Long-Term**: May be needed for complex trauma or chronic conditions.

## What Improvement Looks Like
- **Feeling Relief**: A sense of unburdening after sharing your struggles.
- **New Insights**: Understanding why you react the way you do.
- **Behavior Change**: Doing things differently (e.g., setting boundaries, facing fears).
- **Symptom Reduction**: Sleeping better, worrying less, feeling more hopeful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Progress is not always linear. You may have ups and downs during the process.
