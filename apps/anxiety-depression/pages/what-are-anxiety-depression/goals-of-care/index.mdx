# Goals of Care

The primary goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and help you return to your normal life.

## What Recovery Looks Like
- **Symptom Reduction**: Feeling less sad, anxious, or worried.
- **Improved Functioning**: Being able to work, socialize, and enjoy hobbies again.
- **Prevention**: Learning skills to prevent future episodes.

## Your Role
- **Be Open**: Share your feelings and symptoms with your care team.
- **Be Patient**: Treatment takes time. It may take a few weeks to feel the full benefits of medication or therapy.
- **Stay Committed**: Stick to your treatment plan, even when you start feeling better.
