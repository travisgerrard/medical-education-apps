# How to Track Symptoms and Triggers

Keeping a record helps you and your provider understand patterns.

## What to Track
- **Mood**: Rate 1-10 daily
- **Sleep**: Hours and quality
- **Anxiety Level**: Rate 1-10
- **Activities**: What you did that day
- **Triggers**:What seemed to make things worse

## Tools
- Paper journal
- Mood tracking apps (Daylio, Moodpath)
- Simple spreadsheet

## Look for Patterns
- Are symptoms worse at certain times?
- Do specific situations trigger anxiety?
- What helps you feel better?

> Tracking doesn't have to be complicated. Even a simple daily mood rating helps.
