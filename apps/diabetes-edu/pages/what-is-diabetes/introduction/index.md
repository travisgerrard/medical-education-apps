Type 2 diabetes is an illness where the body is unable to process the
glucose (sugar) in your blood from the food you eat.

Diabetes is a serious condition that requires daily self-care.

Many people in the United States have diabetes and do not know it.

Changes to the way the body processes sugar may occur long before the
patient is diagnosed with diabetes.

The purpose of this program is to provide people with information for
