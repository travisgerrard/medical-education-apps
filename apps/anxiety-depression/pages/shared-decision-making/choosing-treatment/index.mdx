# How to Choose Between Therapy, Meds, Exercise, or Combinations

Each treatment has benefits. Often, combining them works best.[^1][^2]

## Therapy Alone
**Best for:**
- Mild to moderate symptoms
- You want to learn long-term coping skills
- No access to or preference against medication

## Medication Alone
**Best for:**
- Moderate to severe symptoms
- Need faster relief
- Limited access to therapy

## Exercise
**Best for:**
- Mild depression
- As an addition to other treatments
- You enjoy physical activity

## Combination (Therapy + Medication)
**Best for:**
- Moderate to severe symptoms
- Fastest and most complete recovery
- Preventing relapse

Clinical guidelines recommend combination treatment for moderate to severe depression as it leads to better outcomes than either treatment alone.[^1][^2]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For moderate to severe depression, combination treatment (therapy + medication) is more effective than either alone and is recommended by NICE and VA/DoD guidelines.
