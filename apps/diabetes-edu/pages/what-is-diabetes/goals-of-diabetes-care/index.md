# Goals of diabetes care

<img src={goalsOfDiabetesCare} />

The goal of care in treatment of type 2 diabetes is to achieve and
maintain an ideal blood glucose, healthy fat levels of the blood
(lipids / cholesterol), and blood pressure control to prevent or delay problems from
diabetes.

Some persons can manage their blood glucose by eating well and
exercising regularly. Losing excess weight and taking care of yourself
by following a self-management plan will help a person achieve blood
glucose control.

> The goal for the blood glucose is to range between 80-130mg/dL before a meal and less than 180 mg/dL 1-2 hours after a meal.

For most patients, the hemoglobin A1C goal is < 7% and the recommendation is for a A1C test every three months.

> However, depending on your age and other medical conditions, your provider may set a higher A1C goal.

Some patients need medication or insulin to manage their blood sugar.

Your diabetes provider may prescribe oral medications or insulin to keep
your blood sugar at the target levels.

Blood pressure goal for many patients is 140/90

> Your provider may choose an individualized blood pressure goal based on your medical history and age.

Goals for lipid management will be defined by your provider based on
your overall health, age and goals of care.
