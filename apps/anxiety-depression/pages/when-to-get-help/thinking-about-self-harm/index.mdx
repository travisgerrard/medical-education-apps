# If You Are Thinking About Self-Harm

Thoughts of self-harm or suicide are frightening, but they are a symptom of a treatable condition. They are not a character flaw.

## You Are Not Alone
Many people experience these thoughts when they are in deep pain. It does not mean you want to die; it often means you want the pain to stop.

## Steps to Stay Safe
1.  **Remove Means**: Get rid of anything you could use to hurt yourself (pills, weapons).
2.  **Delay**: Promise yourself you will wait 24 hours before acting.
3.  **Connect**: Talk to someone you trust or call a helpline.
4.  **Distract**: Do something to occupy your mind (listen to music, watch a movie).
