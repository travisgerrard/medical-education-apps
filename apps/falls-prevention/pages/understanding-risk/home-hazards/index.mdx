# Home Hazards

Most falls happen at home, in familiar surroundings. Identifying and fixing home hazards is one of the most effective fall prevention strategies.

## Where Falls Happen

**Statistics:**
- **55%** of falls occur inside the home
- **20%** happen on stairs or steps
- Bathrooms and bedrooms are the highest-risk rooms

## Common Indoor Hazards

### Floors and Surfaces

**Throw Rugs and Mats**
- Problems: Edges curl up, rugs slide on smooth floors
- Falls happen when: Toes catch on edges or rugs slip
- Solution: Remove all throw rugs or secure with non-slip backing

**Clutter**
- Problems: Shoes, cords, newspapers, bags on floor
- Falls happen when: You don't see objects or trip over them
- Solution: Keep walking paths completely clear

**Slippery Floors**
- Problems: Recently waxed, wet, or polished surfaces
- Falls happen when: Feet slide, especially in socks
- Solution: Use non-skid floor wax, clean up spills immediately

### Lighting Issues

**Insufficient Light**
- Problems: Shadows, dark hallways, can't see obstacles
- Falls happen when: Eyes don't adjust quickly to darkness
- Solution: Install bright lights, use nightlights

**Poor Light Placement**
- Problems: Light switches far from room entrances
- Falls happen when: Walking in dark to reach switch
- Solution: Install switches at room entrances, use motion sensors

### Stairs and Steps

**Missing Handrails**
- Falls happen when: Loss of balance with nothing to grab
- Solution: Install sturdy handrails on both sides

**Poor Stair Visibility**
- Problems: Can't see step edges, worn carpet, poor lighting
- Falls happen when: Misjudging step height or depth
- Solution: Mark step edges with bright tape, improve lighting

**Unsafe Stair Features**
- Loose carpet or treads
- Uneven step heights
- Items stored on stairs
- Narrow steps

### Furniture and Layout

**Unstable Furniture**
- Problems: Using wobbly chairs or tables for support
- Falls happen when: Furniture tips or rolls away
- Solution: Remove wheeled furniture from support paths

**Low Furniture**
- Problems: Coffee tables, footstools, pet beds
- Falls happen when: Bumping into low objects
- Solution: Rearrange or remove items from walking paths

**Reaching and Bending**
- Problems: Items stored too high or too low
- Falls happen when: Overreaching, using unstable step stools
- Solution: Store frequently used items at waist height

## Room-by-Room Hazards

### Kitchen
- Spills on floor (water, oil, food)
- Step stools without handrails
- Cabinets too high
- Cords from appliances creating trip hazards

### Bathroom
- Wet, slippery floors and tub
- No grab bars near toilet or shower
- Bath mats without suction cups
- Reaching over high tub sides

### Bedroom
- Low bed height (hard to get in/out)
- Clutter on floor (clothes, shoes)
- Light switch far from bed
- Bedside tables just out of reach

### Living Room
- Low coffee tables
- Extension cords across walking paths
- Thick carpets or rugs with padding
- Remote controls and reading materials on floor

## Outdoor Hazards

### Walkways and Driveways
- Cracked or uneven pavement
- Wet leaves, ice, or snow
- Poor lighting
- Lack of handrails on outdoor steps

### Yard
- Uneven ground
- Garden hoses left across paths
- Rocks or roots
- Steps without visible edges

## Pets

While we love our animals, they can increase fall risk:
- Tripping over pets underfoot
- Leashes tangling around legs
- Rushing to feed or let them out
- Pet toys left on floor

**Solution**: Train pets, use gates to control access, establish routines

## Quick Home Safety Check

Walk through your home and ask:
- □ Can I walk freely without dodging objects?
- □ Are all areas well-lit?
- □ Can I reach light switches easily?
- □ Are floors non-slip and clear?
- □ Do all stairs have handrails?
- □ Is my bathroom safe when wet?

## Professional Home Assessment

Consider asking for an occupational therapy home safety evaluation if you:
- Have fallen at home
- Feel unsafe navigating your home
- Recently developed mobility problems
- Are returning home after hospitalization
