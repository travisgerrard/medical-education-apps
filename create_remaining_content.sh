# Tracking Progress and Staying Consistent

Consistency is more important than intensity.

## Track Your Exercise
- Use a simple calendar or app
- Mark days you exercise
- Note how you felt before and after
- Celebrate small wins

## Build the Habit
- Same time each day helps
- Link it to an existing habit (e.g., "After my morning coffee, I walk")
- Prepare the night before

## Stay Motivated
- Set realistic goals
- Find an exercise buddy
- Reward yourself (non-food rewards)
- Remember your "why"

> [!TIP]
> Missing a day doesn't mean failure. Just get back on track the next day.

# Worry Management and Thought Reframing

You can't stop anxious thoughts, but you can change how you respond to them.

## Recognize Thinking Traps
- **All-or-Nothing**: "I made one mistake, I'm a total failure"
- **Catastrophizing**: "This will be a disaster"
- **Mind Reading**: "They think I'm stupid"

## Challenge the Thought
1. What's the evidence for this thought?
2. What's the evidence against it?
3. What would I tell a friend thinking this?
4. What's a more balanced thought?

## Worry Time
- Schedule 15 minutes a day to worry
- When worries come up outside that time, write them down for later
- During worry time, problem-solve what you can and let go of what you can't control

> [!NOTE]
> The goal isn't to eliminate all negative thoughts. It's to reduce their power over you.

# Behavioral Activation for Depression

Depression makes you want to withdraw. Behavioral activation means doing things even when you don't feel like it.

## The Activity-Mood Connection
When you're depressed, you stop doing things you enjoy, which makes you feel worse, which makes you do even less. It's a cycle.

## Break the Cycle
1. **Make a list** of activities you used to enjoy
2. **Start small**: Pick one easy activity
3. **Schedule it**: Put it on your calendar
4. **Do it anyway**: Even if you don't feel like it
5. **Notice**: How did you feel after?

## Examples of Activating Activities
- Call a friend
- Take a short walk
- Listen to music
- Cook a favorite meal
- Work on a hobby

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't need to wait until you "feel like it." Action comes first, mood improves second.

# Sleep Routines and Light Exposure

Sleep and mood are closely connected.

## Sleep Hygiene Basics
- **Consistent Schedule**: Same bedtime and wake time every day
- **Wind-Down Routine**: 30 minutes of calming activities before bed
- **Cool, Dark, Quiet Room**: Aim for 65-68°F
- **No Screens**: Stop using phones/tablets 1 hour before bed

## Light Exposure
- **Morning Light**: Get 15-30 minutes of bright light (ideally sunlight) within 1 hour of waking
- **Dim Evening Light**: Reduce light exposure 2-3 hours before bed

## If You Can't Sleep
- Don't lie in bed awake for more than 20 minutes
- Get up and do something calm (read, listen to quiet music)
- Go back to bed when you feel sleepy

> [!TIP]
> Light exposure is one of the most powerful (and free!) ways to regulate mood and sleep.

# Alcohol, Cannabis, Caffeine, and Mood

What you consume affects your mental health.

## Alcohol
- Depresses the central nervous system
- May temporarily reduce anxiety but worsens depression over time
- Interferes with sleep quality
- Interacts with antidepressants

**Recommendation**: Limit to 1 drink per day for women, 2 for men. Consider avoiding entirely during treatment.

## Cannabis
- May temporarily reduce anxiety for some, increase it for others
- Can worsen depression with chronic use
- Reduces motivation (not helpful for depression)

## Caffeine
- Can increase anxiety and panic attacks
- Disrupts sleep if consumed after 2 PM
- Withdrawal causes headaches and irritability

**Recommendation**: Limit to 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning. Avoid if you have anxiety.

> [!WARNING]
> Using alcohol or drugs to cope with symptoms is a red flag. Talk to your doctor.

# How Clinicians Diagnose Anxiety and Depression

There's no blood test for depression or anxiety. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.

## The Diagnostic Process
1. **Symptom Review**: Your provider asks about specific symptoms
2. **Duration**: How long have you felt this way?
3. **Severity**: How much do symptoms interfere with your life?
4. **Medical History**: Rule out physical causes (thyroid, anemia, etc.)

## Screening Tools
- **PHQ-9** for depression
- **GAD-7** for anxiety

Scores help quantify severity but don't diagnose alone.

## Differential Diagnosis
Your provider will also consider:
- Bipolar disorder (if you've had manic episodes)
- PTSD (if you've experienced trauma)
- Medical conditions that mimic depression (thyroid disease)

> [!NOTE]
> An accurate diagnosis guides the right treatment.

# Follow-Up Schedules and Measurement-Based Care

Regular check-ins help ensure treatment is working.

## Typical Follow-Up Schedule
- **First Month on Medication**: Every 1-2 weeks
- **Months 2-3**: Every 3-4 weeks
- **After Stabilization**: Every 1-3 months

## Measurement-Based Care
Your provider may ask you to complete PHQ-9 or GAD-7 at each visit to:
- Track progress objectively
- Decide if treatment needs adjustment
- Catch early signs of relapse

## What to Report
- Changes in symptoms (better or worse)
- Side effects
- Life stressors
- Suicidal thoughts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't wait until your appointment if you're having suicidal thoughts or a crisis. Call or go to the ER.

# How to Track Symptoms and Triggers

Keeping a record helps you and your provider understand patterns.

## What to Track
- **Mood**: Rate 1-10 daily
- **Sleep**: Hours and quality
- **Anxiety Level**: Rate 1-10
- **Activities**: What you did that day
- **Triggers**:What seemed to make things worse

## Tools
- Paper journal
- Mood tracking apps (Daylio, Moodpath)
- Simple spreadsheet

## Look for Patterns
- Are symptoms worse at certain times?
- Do specific situations trigger anxiety?
- What helps you feel better?

> [!TIP]
> Tracking doesn't have to be complicated. Even a simple daily mood rating helps.

# How to Talk About Medicines and Stopping Safely

Good communication about medication prevents problems.

## Be Honest About
- Side effects you're experiencing
- Whether you're taking the medication as prescribed
- Other medications or supplements
- Alcohol or drug use

## Questions to Ask Your Doctor
- Why this medication?
- What side effects should I watch for?
- When should I start feeling better?
- How long will I need to take this?
- What happens if I miss a dose?

## If You Want to Stop
**Don't stop on your own.** Talk to your doctor. They will:
- Assess if you're ready
- Create a tapering schedule
- Plan for monitoring after stopping

> [!WARNING]
> Stopping antidepressants suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms and increase the risk of relapse.
