# Introduction

Understanding your personal fall risk is the first step toward preventing falls. Everyone's risk is different, and identifying yours helps you focus on the most effective prevention strategies.

## Why Assess Your Risk?

Falls rarely happen by chance. They occur when multiple risk factors combine at the same moment. The good news: many risk factors can be reduced or eliminated.
