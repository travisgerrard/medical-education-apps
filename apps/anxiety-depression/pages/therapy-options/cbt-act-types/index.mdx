There are many different types of therapy, but some have more evidence supporting their effectiveness for anxiety and depression than others. The most widely studied and recommended approaches are "talk therapies" that focus on changing patterns of thinking and behavior.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
CBT focuses on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It helps you identify negative thinking patterns (like "I'm a failure") and challenge them with more realistic thoughts.

CBT is recommended by NICE and APA guidelines as a first-line treatment for depression and anxiety.[^1][^2] It has strong evidence showing it works as well as medication for many people.

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
ACT teaches you to accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, while committing to actions that align with your values.

## Other Types
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: Focuses on improving relationships and social functioning.
- **Psychodynamic Therapy**: Explores how past experiences influence current behavior.
- **Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)**: Combines mindfulness meditation with CBT principles.
