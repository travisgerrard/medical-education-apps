# How Long to Stay on Medication and How Tapering Works

Once you feel better, how long should you stay on medication?

## Recommendations
- **First Episode**: Stay on medication for at least 6-12 months after feeling better
- **Recurrent Depression**: May need to stay on medication for years or indefinitely
- **Chronic Anxiety**: Often requires long-term treatment

## Why Continue When You Feel Better?
Stopping too soon increases the risk of relapse. Continuing medication after recovery helps prevent symptoms from returning.

## When to Consider Stopping
Talk to your doctor if:
- You've been well for at least 6-12 months
- You've addressed contributing factors (stress, sleep, relationships)
- You're willing to restart if symptoms return

## Tapering Process
Never stop suddenly. Your doctor will create a gradual tapering plan:
- Slowly reduce the dose over weeks to months
- Monitor for withdrawal symptoms or returning depression/anxiety
- If symptoms return, you may need to stay on medication longer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Needing long-term medication doesn't mean you're "weak." It's like taking medication for diabetes or high blood pressure.
