# Anxiety and Depression Together

It is very common for anxiety and depression to occur at the same time. In fact, nearly half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

## Why They Overlap

The biological mechanisms for anxiety and depression are similar. They involve the same neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine.

## Shared Symptoms
- Sleep problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Fatigue
- Irritability

## Treating Both

Because they are so closely linked, treatments often overlap.
- **Medications**: SSRIs and SNRIs are effective for both conditions.
- **Therapy**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) works well for both.

> Treating one condition often helps the other. Your care plan will likely address both simultaneously.
