# When to Talk with a Clinician

You don't need to wait until things get "bad enough" to seek help.

## Signs It's Time
- **Interference with Daily Life**: Symptoms make it hard to work, go to school, or take care of yourself.
- **Persistent Symptoms**: You've felt down or anxious for more than two weeks.
- **Physical Symptoms**: Unexplained aches, pains, or sleep problems.
- **Substance Use**: You're using alcohol or drugs to cope.
- **Relationship Strain**: Your mood is affecting your relationships with friends or family.

## Who to Contact
- **Primary Care Provider**: A good first step for screening and referrals.
- **Therapist or Counselor**: For talk therapy.
- **Psychiatrist**: For medication management.

> [!NOTE]
> Early intervention often leads to better and faster recovery.
