# What to Do If Therapy Is Not Working

If you've been in therapy for a while and don't feel better, don't give up.

## Check In
- **Talk to Your Therapist**: Be honest about what's working and what isn't. They can adjust their approach.
- **Review Your Goals**: Are you working on the right things?

## Consider Changes
- **Try a Different Type**: If talk therapy isn't helping, maybe a skills-based approach like CBT would be better.
- **Switch Therapists**: Sometimes it's just not a good personality fit. That's okay.
- **Add Medication**: Sometimes symptoms are too severe to manage with therapy alone.
