# What to Do When Therapy Isn't Working

![Person at crossroads with signposts](/images/therapy_not_working_crossroads.png)

Therapy is a relationship, and like any relationship, sometimes it just doesn't click. Or maybe you've been going for a while and feel stuck. This can be incredibly frustrating and discouraging. **But please don't give up on getting help.** Therapy not working doesn't mean *you* are broken—it means something about the current approach needs to change.

## First: How Long Have You Been Trying?

**Give it time**: Most people don't see significant improvement until at least **8-12 sessions**. Early sessions are often about building trust and understanding the problem, not solving it yet.

**But trust your gut**: If after 3-4 months you see *zero* progress or feel consistently worse, it's time to reassess.

## Common Reasons Therapy Isn't Helping

### 1. The Type of Therapy Doesn't Match Your Needs

**The problem**: Different therapies work for different issues. If you're getting insight-oriented therapy but need concrete coping skills for panic attacks, you might not improve.

**Examples of mismatches**:
- You need **CBT** (skills-based) but are getting psychodynamic therapy (insight focused)
- You need **trauma-focused therapy** (EMDR, CPT) but are getting general talk therapy
- You're in **individual therapy** but need couples or family therapy to address relationship issues

**What to do**: Ask your therapist if the approach is right for your specific problem. If not, ask for a referral to someone who specializes in what you need.

### 2. The Therapist Isn't a Good Fit

**The problem**: Even if the therapist is skilled, the relationship might not click. Therapy requires trust, and if you don't feel comfortable, progress stalls.

**Signs it's not a good fit**:
- You don't feel heard or understood
- You feel judged or dismissed
- The therapist talks too much (or too little)
- Your personalities clash
- You dread going to sessions
- You hold back and can't be fully honest

**What to do**: It's okay to say, "I don't think this is the right fit for me." You don't need to justify it. Ask for a referral to someone else.

**This is common and normal**. Finding the right therapist can take a few tries.

### 3. You're Not Being Fully Honest

**The problem**: Therapy only works if you're open about what's really going on. If you minimize symptoms, avoid difficult topics, or say what you think the therapist wants to hear, progress is impossible.

**Why people hold back**:
- Shame or embarrassment
- Fear of judgment
- Worry about being hospitalized if you mention suicidal thoughts
- Not wanting to burden the therapist
- Not fully trusting the therapist yet

**What to do**: 
- Remind yourself: therapists have heard it all and won't judge you
- Start small: "There's something I haven't told you, and it's hard to say..."
- If you're worried about confidentiality, ask your therapist to clarify when they would need to break it

### 4. You're Not Doing the Work Outside of Sessions

**The problem**: Therapy isn't passive. If you're not practicing skills, doing homework, or trying new behaviors between sessions, progress will be slow.

**What therapy homework might look like**:
- Thought records (writing down negative thoughts and challenging them)
- Exposure exercises (gradually facing fears)
- Behavioral activation (scheduling enjoyable activities)
- Journaling or self-reflection

**What to do**: Be honest with your therapist if homework feels too hard, confusing, or irrelevant. They can adjust.

### 5. Your Symptoms Are Too Severe for Therapy Alone

**The problem**: Moderate to severe depression and anxiety often respond better to **therapy + medication** than therapy alone.

**Signs you might need medication**:
- You can barely function (can't get out of bed, missing work regularly)
- You can't concentrate well enough to engage in therapy
- You've been in therapy for months with zero improvement
- You have suicidal thoughts

**What to do**: Ask your therapist for a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation.

### 6. An Underlying Issue Isn't Being Addressed

**The problem**: Sometimes there's a medical or life circumstance making it impossible to improve.

**Examples**:
- Undiagnosed medical condition (thyroid disorder, sleep apnea, chronic pain)
- Active substance use (alcohol, drugs undermine therapy effectiveness)
- Ongoing trauma (you're in an abusive relationship or unsafe living situation)
- Untreated ADHD or autism making therapy hard to engage with

**What to do**: Talk to your therapist about whether something else might be interfering. They can help you address these issues first or in parallel.

### 7. The Goals Are Wrong

**The problem**: You and your therapist might be working toward goals that don't actually matter to you, or that aren't realistic.

**Example**: Your therapist focuses on helping you feel less anxious at work, but what you really need is help deciding whether to leave your job.

**What to do**: Revisit your goals. Say, "I don't think what we're working on is what I really need. Can we talk about my priorities?"

## How to Talk to Your Therapist

**It's okay to be direct**. In fact, it's essential. Here's how:

### What to Say

"I've been coming for [X weeks/months], and I don't feel like I'm getting better. Can we talk about what might be going on?"

"I'm not sure this approach is working for me. Are there other options we could try?"

"I don't think we're a good fit, and I'd like a referral to someone else."

### What a Good Therapist Will Do

- **Listen without getting defensive**
- **Ask what's not working** and explore it with you
- **Offer to adjust the approach** or refer you to someone better suited
- **Support your decision** if you want to switch therapists

### What If Your Therapist Reacts Poorly?

If your therapist gets defensive, dismissive, or makes you feel bad for bringing this up, **that's a sign you need a new therapist**. A good therapist welcomes feedback and wants you to feel empowered.

## When to Try a Different Therapist

**Consider switching if**:
- You've given it 8-12 sessions and see zero progress
- You don't feel comfortable opening up
- Your therapist doesn't specialize in your issue (e.g., you have PTSD and they don't have trauma training)
- You've expressed concerns and nothing changes
- You just don't click

**How to switch**:
1. Tell your current therapist you'd like to try someone else (ask for referrals)
2. Search for therapists who specialize in your specific issue
3. Do a consultation call with new therapists to see if they seem like a better fit

**You don't owe your therapist loyalty**. Your only obligation is to yourself and your healing.

## When to Try a Different Type of Therapy

If you've switched therapists and still aren't improving, the **modality** (type of therapy) might be the issue.

**Examples**:
- Switch from **psychodynamic therapy → CBT** (if you need concrete skills)
- Switch from **talk therapy → EMDR** (if you have trauma)
- Switch from **individual → group therapy** (if you need social connection and support)
- Switch from **CBT → ACT** (if you struggle with accepting emotions rather than changing them)

**Ask a new therapist**: "What type of therapy do you practice, and is it effective for [your specific issue]?"

## When to Add Medication

If you've tried therapy (with a good fit therapist) for 3-6 months and still aren't improving, adding **medication** often helps.

**Why combination works**:
- Medication can reduce symptoms enough that you can engage in therapy
- Therapy teaches you skills to manage symptoms long-term
- Together, they're more effective than either alone

**What to do**: Ask for a referral to a psychiatrist or see your primary care doctor.

##When to Take a Break

Sometimes you're not ready for therapy, and that's okay.

**Reasons to pause**:
- You're in survival mode (dealing with a crisis, housing insecurity, etc.)
- You're too exhausted to engage
- You need to focus on other things first (like getting medical issues treated)

**What to do**: It's okay to say, "I need to take a break for now." You can always return when you're ready.

## You Deserve Care That Helps

**Advocating for yourself is part of the healing process**. Therapy should feel:
- **Safe**: You can be honest without fear of judgment
- **Collaborative**: You and your therapist work together as a team
- **Helpful**: You see progress, even if it's slow

**If it doesn't feel that way, something needs to change**—and that's okay. Keep trying until you find the right fit.
