**Multiple chronic conditions:**

- Program modifications needed

**Very deconditioned:**

- Very gradual progression

## Remember

The best fall prevention program is the one you'll actually do consistently. Start somewhere—anywhere—and adjust as needed.

Research shows all these programs work, but only if you participate regularly for at least 12 weeks.

You don't need to choose just one. Many people combine home exercises with a group class, or Tai Chi with walking.

The time and effort you invest in exercise is the single best investment in your independence and safety. No medication or home modification is more effective than the right exercise program.

Start today. Your future self will thank you.
