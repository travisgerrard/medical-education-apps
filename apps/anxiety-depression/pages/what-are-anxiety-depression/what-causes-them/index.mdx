# What Causes Them?

There is no single cause for anxiety or depression. They result from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors.

## Biological Factors
- **Brain Chemistry**: Imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.
- **Genetics**: A family history of mental health conditions increases risk.

## Environmental Factors
- **Trauma**: Abuse, loss of a loved one, or other traumatic events.
- **Stress**: Chronic stress at work, home, or financially.
- **Life Changes**: Even positive changes like a new baby or job can trigger symptoms.

## Psychological Factors
- **Personality**: People who are easily overwhelmed or have low self-esteem may be more prone.
