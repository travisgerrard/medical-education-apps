# How to Start When You Feel Tired or Unmotivated

Depression and anxiety rob you of energy and motivation. Here's how to overcome that.

## The Motivation Trap
Don't wait to "feel like it." Action comes first, then motivation follows.

## Strategies That Help
1. **Make it Easy**: Lay out your workout clothes the night before
2. **Start Tiny**: Just 5 minutes. You can always do more once you start
3. **Schedule It**: Treat it like a doctor's appointment
4. **Find a Buddy**: Accountability helps
5. **Remove Barriers**: Exercise at home if going to a gym feels overwhelming

## Overcome Common Obstacles
- **"I'm too tired"**: Exercise actually increases energy
- **"I don't have time"**: Start with just 10 minutes
- **"I hate exercise"**: Find a form of movement you enjoy (dancing, gardening, playing with pets)
