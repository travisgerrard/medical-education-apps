# Finding a Therapist and Affording Care

Finding the right therapist is crucial for success.

## Where to Look
- **Insurance Directory**: Check your health plan's list of in-network providers.
- **Online Directories**: Psychology Today, TherapyDen, or specialized directories for specific communities.
- **Referrals**: Ask your primary care doctor or friends for recommendations.

## Affording Care
- **Insurance**: Many plans cover mental health services. Check your copay and deductible.
- **Sliding Scale**: Some therapists offer reduced rates based on income.
- **Community Clinics**: Often provide low-cost or free services.
- **Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)**: Many employers offer a few free sessions.
