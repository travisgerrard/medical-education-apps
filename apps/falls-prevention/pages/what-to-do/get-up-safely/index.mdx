# How to Get Up Safely

If you've fallen and aren't seriously injured, getting up the right way prevents further injury. Never rush—take your time.

## First: Assess Yourself

**Before moving, check:**
- Are you hurt?
- Can you move all limbs?
- Any severe pain?
- Bleeding?
- Hit your head?
- Feeling dizzy or confused?

**If YES to any**: Don't try to get up. Call for help.

**If NO**: You may be able to get up safely using the technique below.

## Rest First

-Don't rush
- Lie still for a minute
- Catch your breath
- Let your body settle
- Plan your movements

## The Safe Get-Up Method

### Step 1: Roll to Your Side
- Roll onto your side (choose the stronger side if one arm/leg is weaker)
- Bend your knees
- Rest if needed

### Step 2: Get to Hands and Knees
- Push up with your arms to prop yourself up on elbow
- Pull yourself to hands and knees position
- Rest again—this is tiring

### Step 3: Crawl to Furniture
- Look for sturdy furniture (heavy chair, couch bed)
- Crawl slowly toward it
- Take breaks if needed
- Don't rush

### Step 4: Place Hands on Furniture
- Put both hands on seat of chair or bed
- Get one foot forward (stronger leg)
- Keep other knee on ground
- Position like you're proposing

### Step 5: Push Up
- Push down on furniture with hands
- Push up with front leg
- Slowly straighten to standing
- Hold onto furniture until steady

### Step 6: Sit and Rest
- Turn carefully
- Sit on furniture
- Rest for several minutes
- Don't stand up right away

## If You Can't Get Up

### When to Stop Trying:
- Too weak  
- Pain increases
- Dizzy or short of breath
- Tried twice with no success
- Feel unsafe

### What to Do:
1. Call for help (phone, medical alert device)
2. If no phone nearby, try to get to one by crawling/sliding
3. If trapped, call out for neighbors
4. Stay warm—pull rug, clothes, towels over you
5. Try to slide on flat surface
6. Keep moving limbs to maintain circulation

## If You're Alone Without Phone

**Prevention is critical:**
- Carry phone always
- Medical alert system
- Cordless phone in every room
- Voice-activated devices ("Alexa, call for help")

**If trapped:**
- Bang on floor/walls to alert neighbors
- If near window, try to attract attention
- Move every 20 minutes to prevent pressure sores
- Stay calm, someone will check on you

## After Getting Up

**Don't immediately resume activities:**
1. Sit for 5-10 minutes
2. Check yourself for injuries
3. Drink water
4. Call someone to let them know
5. Consider calling doctor
6. Write down what happened

## Practice This Technique

**When you're well:**
- Practice getting down to floor and up (with supervision)
- Know which furniture is sturdy enough
- Identify best path from each room
- Build strength and confidence

**Practice locations:**
- Bedroom (practice getting to bed)
- Living room (practice with different furniture)
- Bathroom (if safe to practice)

## Tools That Help

**Getting up aids:**
- Step stool strategically placed
- Grab bars on walls
- Sturdy furniture at floor level throughout home

## Long-Lie Syndrome

**Danger of staying down too long:**
- Afterlife 30-60 minutes: dehydration, pressure sores, pneumonia begins
-Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) possible
- Hypothermia in cold environments
- Psychological trauma

**This is why:**
- Medical alert systems save lives
- Regular check-in calls important
- Neighbors should know to check
- Must be able to call for help

## Teaching Others

**Family/caregivers should know:**
- Never try to lift you alone (injury risk to both)
- Call for help if they can't assist you safely
- Two-person assist technique if needed
- When to call 911

## Special Situations

### Bathroom Falls
- May be wet, slippery
- Less room to maneuver
- Often no close sturdy furniture
- **Don't try to get up if wet—wait for help**

### Outdoor Falls
- Ground may be uneven
- Less sturdy "furniture"
- Cold/hot weather concerns
- **Call for help rather than risk further injury**

### At Night
- Turn on lights first if possible
- Take extra time
- Vision worse
- May be groggy

## Preventing the Fear Cycle

**After getting up:**
- Pride in successful technique
- Recognize you CAN recover
- Don't let fear paralyze you
- Use experience to prevent next fall

## Remember

Getting up safely is a skill you hope never to use, but one worth knowing. Practice when you're well so the movements are familiar if needed.

Never feel you "should" be able to get up if you can't. Calling for help is the smart, safe choice.

The biggest danger isn't the fall—it's lying on the floor too long. Always have a way to call for help.

If you've fallen once and struggled to get up, strongly consider a medical alert system. It could save your life.
