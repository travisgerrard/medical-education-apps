# What to Expect in an Urgent Evaluation

If you go to the emergency room or a crisis center, here is what typically happens.

## Triage
A nurse will assess your physical condition and ask about your symptoms to prioritize your care.

## Assessment
A mental health professional (psychiatrist, social worker, or nurse practitioner) will talk to you about:
- Your current symptoms and safety.
- Your medical and mental health history.
- Any substance use.

## Plan
Based on the assessment, they will recommend a plan:
- **Outpatient Care**: Going home with a referral to a therapist or clinic.
- **Inpatient Care**: Staying in the hospital for a few days for safety and stabilization.

> The goal is to keep you safe and connect you with the right level of care.
