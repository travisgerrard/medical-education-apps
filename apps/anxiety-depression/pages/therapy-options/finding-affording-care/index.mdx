![Compass pointing the way to care](/images/finding_care.png)

Finding the right therapist or psychiatrist can feel overwhelming, especially when you're already feeling low or anxious. But there are many resources available to help you find affordable, effective care.
- **Online Directories**: Psychology Today, TherapyDen, or specialized directories for specific communities.
- **Referrals**: Ask your primary care doctor or friends for recommendations.

## Affording Care
- **Insurance**: Many plans cover mental health services. Check your copay and deductible.
- **Sliding Scale**: Some therapists offer reduced rates based on income.
- **Community Clinics**: Often provide low-cost or free services.
- **Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)**: Many employers offer a few free sessions.
