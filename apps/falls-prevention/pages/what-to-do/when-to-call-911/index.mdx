# When to Call 911

Some falls require immediate emergency care. Know when to call 911 and when you can wait to see your doctor.

## ALWAYS Call 911 If:

### Serious Injuries
- **Head injury** with loss of consciousness (even brief)
- Severe headache after head impact
- Confusion or altered mental status
- **Suspected broken bones** (severe pain, deformity, can't move limb)
- **Hip fracture**: Can't stand, severe groin/hip pain
- Large open wounds or heavy bleeding
- Severe pain anywhere

### Medical Emergencies Causing Fall
- **Chest pain or pressure**
- **Difficulty breathing**
- **Slurred speech or facial drooping** (stroke signs)
- **Weakness on one side of body**
- **Seizure**
- **Severe dizziness with vomiting**
- **Loss of consciousness**

### Can't Get Up
- Tried safe techniques but unable to rise
- Lying on floor more than 15-20 minutes
- No one to help you
- Feel weak or injured

### Signs of Serious Head Injury

**Call 911 if you hit your head and have:**
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe headache
- Repeated vomiting
- Confusion or memory loss
- Unequal pupils
- Clear fluid from nose or ears
- Sleepiness/difficulty staying awake
- Slurred speech

## When You Can Wait

**See doctor soon (within 24 hours) if:**
- Minor bruising or soreness
- Small cuts (not bleeding heavily)
- You got up OK and feel mostly fine
- Mild headache without other symptoms
- Second or third fall recently

## What to Tell 911

**Be ready to report:**
1. "I've fallen and need help"
2. Your location (address, apartment number)
3. Your injuries
4. Whether you can move
5. Medical conditions
6. Medications (especially blood thinners)
7. Whether you're alone

## If You Take Blood Thinners

**Warfarin (Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa):**

**Call 911 for ANY head injury**, even if you feel fine:
- Blood thinners increase bleeding risk
- Brain bleeding can be delayed
- May not have immediate symptoms
- Medical evaluation essential

## Special Considerations

### Living Alone
**Before a fall:**
- Medical alert system
- Phone within reach at all times
- Neighbors know to check on you
- Schedule check-in calls

**After a fall:**
- Call for help even if you think you're OK
- Don't minimize injuries
- Better safe than sorry

### If Someone Falls in Front of You

**Don't rush to move them:**
1. Check if they're conscious and breathing
2. Call 911 if serious injury suspected
3. Keep them still if neck/back injury possible
4. Cover with blanket while waiting
5. Reassure them
6. Don't give food or water

## Common Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Try to "tough it out"
- Refuse ambulance due to cost (health more important)
- Minimize symptoms to avoid "bothering" anyone
- Wait to "see how you feel tomorrow"
- Let embarrassment delay calling for help

## Cost Concerns

**If worried about ambulance cost:**
- Your life is worth more than the bill
- Medicare covers emergency transport
- Many areas have payment plans
- Some injuries get much more expensive if untreated

## Remember

When in doubt, call 911. Emergency responders would rather check you and find you're OK than have you seriously injured at home alone.

Brain injuries and hip fractures can initially seem minor but have severe consequences. Don't try to determine severity yourself.

There's no shame in falling or needing help. Quick, appropriate response can prevent complications and save your life.

Minutes matter with stroke, heart attack, and serious bleeding. Don't delay.
