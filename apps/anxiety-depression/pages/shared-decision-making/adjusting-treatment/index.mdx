# When to Increase the Dose, Switch, or Add Another Treatment

If your current treatment isn't working, there are options.

## Increase the Dose
**Consider if:**
- You've had some improvement but not enough
- You're tolerating the medication well
- You've been at the current dose for 4-6 weeks

## Switch Medications
**Consider if:**
- No improvement after 8 weeks at a therapeutic dose
- Intolerable side effects
- You've tried increasing the dose without success

## Add Another Treatment
**Options:**
- **Add Therapy**: If you're only on medication
- **Add a Second Medication**: Sometimes combining two medications is helpful
- **Add Lifestyle Changes**: Exercise, sleep hygiene, stress reduction

> It's not uncommon to try 2-3 different medications before finding the right one. Don't get discouraged.
