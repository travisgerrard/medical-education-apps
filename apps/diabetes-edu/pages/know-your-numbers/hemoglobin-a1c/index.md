# Hemoglobin A1C

While the glucometer tests blood sugar at a specific moment in time, the
Hemoglobin A1C reports the average blood glucose the previous two to
three months.

The Hemoglobin A1 blood test is drawn and processed at a laboratory.

The Hemoglobin A1C test measures the percentage of the hemoglobin in red
blood cells that are coated with sugar.

Like a sugary drink spilled on the floor that becomes sticky, as glucose
floats in the blood for a long period of time, glucose sticks to our red
blood cells. Hemoglobin A1C measures how many of our red-blood cells
have glucose stuck to them.

The following chart is a comparison of A1C to estimated average glucose
readings you would get from a glucometer.

The A1C test is a common blood test to monitor how well you are managing
your diabetes. The higher your A1C is, the higher the risk of
complications from diabetes.
