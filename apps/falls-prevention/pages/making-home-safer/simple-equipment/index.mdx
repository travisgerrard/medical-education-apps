## Remember

Equipment is a tool, not a cure. It works best when combined with:

- Home safety modifications
- Proper footwear

The right equipment allows you to stay independent and active. Don't let pride keep you from using helpful aids—they enable your continued freedom, not limit it.

Start with one or two items that address your biggest risks, then add more as needed.
