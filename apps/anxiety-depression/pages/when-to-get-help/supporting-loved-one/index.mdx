# Supporting a Loved One

![Hands reaching out for support](/images/support_hand.png)

Watching someone you care about struggle with anxiety or depression can be painful and confusing. You might feel helpless or unsure of what to say. Your support can make a huge difference, but it's important to know how to help effectively.

## Do's
- **Listen**: Let them talk without judging or trying to "fix" it immediately.
- **Validate**: Acknowledge their pain ("That sounds really hard").
- **Encourage Help**: Gently suggest talking to a professional.
- **Check In**: Send a text or call just to say you're thinking of them.

## Don'ts
- **Don't Minimize**: Avoid saying "Just snap out of it" or "Others have it worse."
- **Don't Ignore**: If they mention suicide, take it seriously.
- **Don't Burn Out**: Take care of your own mental health too.
