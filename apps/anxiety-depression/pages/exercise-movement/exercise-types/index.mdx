# Which Types of Exercise Help Most

Different types of exercise offer different benefits for anxiety and depression. The good news: almost any form of physical activity can improve your mental health. The key is finding something you enjoy and can stick with.

## Aerobic Exercise (Cardio)

**What It Is**: Continuous movement that gets your heart rate up and makes you breathe harder.

**Examples**:
- Walking or jogging
- Running
- Swimming or water aerobics
- Cycling or stationary biking
- Dancing
- Jumping rope
- Hiking
- Rowing

**Mental Health Benefits**:
- Increases endorphins (natural mood boosters)
- Reduces stress hormones like cortisol
- Improves sleep quality
- Decreases anxiety symptoms
- Boosts self-esteem
- Provides a healthy distraction from negative thoughts

**Recommendation**: Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 3-5 times per week. "Moderate intensity" means you can talk but not sing during the activity.

**Why It Works**: Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, promotes the growth of new brain cells, and triggers the release of feel-good chemicals.

## Strength Training (Resistance Exercise)

**What It Is**: Exercise that uses resistance to build muscle strength.

**Examples**:
- Free weights (dumbbells, barbells)
- Weight machines
- Resistance bands
- Bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, planks)
- Kettlebell training

**Mental Health Benefits**:
- Builds confidence and sense of accomplishment
- Improves body image and self-efficacy
- Reduces anxiety symptoms
- Enhances cognitive function
- Provides structure and goal-setting opportunities

**Recommendation**: 2-3 sessions per week, targeting major muscle groups. Start with lighter weights and proper form.

**Why It Works**: Strength training releases mood-boosting hormones, provides tangible progress you can see and measure, and gives you a sense of control.

## Yoga and Mind-Body Exercise

**What It Is**: Movement practices that combine physical postures with breath control and mindfulness.

**Types**:
- **Hatha Yoga**: Gentle, slower-paced, great for beginners
- **Vinyasa/Flow Yoga**: More dynamic, linking breath with movement
- **Restorative Yoga**: Very gentle, focuses on relaxation
- **Yin Yoga**: Long-held poses, meditative
- **Tai Chi**: Slow, flowing movements from martial arts
- **Qigong**: Gentle movement with breathing exercises

**Mental Health Benefits**:
- Combines physical activity with mindfulness and meditation
- Reduces muscle tension and physical stress symptoms
- Improves mind-body connection and body awareness
- Teaches breathing techniques useful for anxiety
- Can be adapted to any fitness level

**Recommendation**: 20-60 minutes, 2-4 times per week. Many studios offer beginner classes or trauma-informed yoga.

**Why It Works**: Mind-body practices activate the relaxation response, lower stress hormones, and teach you to stay present rather than ruminating.

## Outdoor Activities (Green Exercise)

**What It Is**: Any physical activity done in nature or green spaces.

**Examples**:
- Walking or hiking in parks or trails
- Gardening
- Outdoor cycling
- Kayaking or canoeing
- Outdoor yoga or tai chi
- Birdwatching walks

**Mental Health Benefits**:
- Combines benefits of exercise with nature exposure (both independently improve mood)
- Reduces rumination and repetitive negative thinking
- Provides vitamin D from sunlight
- Offers a change of scenery from indoor environments
- Can feel less "gym-like" and more enjoyable

**Recommendation**: Even 5-10 minutes of outdoor activity can boost mood. Aim for at least 2 hours per week in nature.

**Why It Works**: Nature exposure has been shown to lower stress hormones, reduce anxiety, and improve attention and focus.

## Social and Group Exercise

**Examples**:
- Group fitness classes (Zumba, spin, boot camp)
- Team sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball)
- Walking or running groups
- Dance classes
- Martial arts
- Tennis or pickleball

**Mental Health Benefits**:
- Combats isolation and loneliness
- Provides social support and accountability
- Creates routine and structure
- Can be more motivating than solo exercise
- Builds social connections

**Why It Works**: Social connection is protective against depression. Exercising with others adds a layer of social support to the physical benefits.

## What the Research Says

Studies consistently show:
- **All types** of exercise can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety
- **Moderate intensity** is often just as effective as high intensity
- **Consistency matters more than intensity** — regular moderate exercise beats occasional intense workouts
- **Enjoyment matters** — you're more likely to stick with activities you find fun

## Choosing What's Right for You

Consider:
- **Your current fitness level**: Start where you are, not where you think you "should" be
- **What you enjoyed as a child or teenager**: Dance? Swimming? Playing outside?
- **Practical barriers**: Time, cost, transportation, weather
- **Health conditions**: Consult your doctor if you have medical concerns
- **What sounds least miserable**: The best exercise is the one you'll actually do
