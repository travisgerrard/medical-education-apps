# Starting, Switching, and Stopping Medicines Safely

Taking medication for mental health is a process, not a one-time event. How you start, switch, or stop medication matters just as much as which one you take.

## Starting a New Medication

### "Start Low, Go Slow"
Doctors usually prescribe a low dose for the first week to let your body adjust, then increase it to the therapeutic dose. This minimizes side effects like nausea or jitteriness.

### The Timeline: What to Expect
- **Week 1**: You might feel side effects (nausea, headache, fatigue) but no mood improvement yet. **Hang in there—this is normal.**
- **Weeks 2-4**: Side effects usually fade. You might notice small changes (sleeping better, less crying).
- **Weeks 4-8**: The full benefit kicks in. You should feel significantly better.

### Tips for Success
- **Take it at the same time daily**: This keeps the level steady in your body.
- **Use a pill box**: It helps you remember and track if you've taken it.
- **Don't skip doses**: Missing even one dose of some meds (like Venlafaxine/Effexor) can cause withdrawal symptoms within hours.

## Switching Medications

If your first medication doesn't work or has bad side effects, switching is common. About 50% of people need to try a second medication to find the right fit.

### How Doctors Switch You
There are a few ways to do this safely:

1.  **Cross-Tapering (Most Common)**:
    - You slowly lower the dose of the old medicine...
    - ...while slowly increasing the dose of the new one.
    - This prevents a gap in treatment.

2.  **Direct Switch**:
    - You stop the old one and start the new one the next day.
    - This is usually done only when switching between similar drugs (e.g., Prozac to Zoloft).

3.  **Washout (Rare)**:
    - You stop the old drug completely and wait days/weeks before starting the new one.
    - This is risky because symptoms can return, so it's avoided unless necessary (e.g., switching to an MAOI).

**Important**: Never switch or stop on your own. Your doctor needs to calculate the equivalent doses.

## Stopping Medication (Deprescribing)

You might be ready to stop if you've been feeling well for **6-12 months**. But stopping requires a plan.

### Discontinuation Syndrome (Withdrawal)
Antidepressants are not "addictive" (you don't crave them), but your brain adapts to them. Stopping suddenly can cause **Discontinuation Syndrome**:
- **Physical**: Dizziness, nausea, "brain zaps" (electric shock sensations), flu-like symptoms.
- **Emotional**: Irritability, crying spells, anxiety, vivid dreams.

### How to Taper Safely
A safe taper can take **weeks or even months**.
- **Standard Taper**: Reducing the dose by 25-50% every 1-2 weeks.
- **Hyperbolic Taper**: Reducing by smaller and smaller amounts as you get to lower doses (e.g., 20mg → 10mg → 5mg → 2.5mg → 0). The last drops are often the hardest.

### Signs of Relapse vs. Withdrawal
It can be hard to tell the difference.
- **Withdrawal**: Starts within days of stopping/lowering. Symptoms often include physical sensations (dizziness, zaps). Improves over time.
- **Relapse**: Usually returns gradually over weeks. Symptoms feel like your original depression/anxiety.

> **Golden Rule**: Never change your dose or stop taking your medication without talking to your provider. A planned taper is the key to staying healthy.
