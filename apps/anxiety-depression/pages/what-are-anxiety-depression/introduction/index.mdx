Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental health conditions worldwide, affecting millions of people every year. The good news: they are highly treatable medical conditions, not personal failings or character flaws.

## Why This Matters

If you're reading this, you may be experiencing symptoms yourself, or you're trying to understand what a loved one is going through. Either way, knowledge is power. Understanding these conditions is the first crucial step toward feeling better.

## What to Expect in This Section

We'll cover the fundamentals:
- **What anxiety and depression actually are** - Clear definitions in plain language
- **How they often occur together** - Why these conditions frequently overlap
- **Common causes and risk factors** - What contributes to developing these conditions
- **The goals of treatment** - What "getting better" looks like and what you can expect

## You Are Not Alone

Depression affects over 280 million people globally. Anxiety disorders affect even more. These are not rare conditions - they are common human experiences that have effective treatments.

Many people who have gone through depression or anxiety have recovered and gone on to live fulfilling lives. With the right support and treatment, you can too.

## A Note on Stigma

There is still stigma around mental health conditions, but attitudes are changing. Having depression or anxiety is no different than having diabetes or high blood pressure - these are medical conditions that respond to treatment.

> You didn't cause your depression or anxiety, and you don't need to face it alone. Help is available, and it works.
