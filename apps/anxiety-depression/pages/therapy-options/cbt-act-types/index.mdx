# CBT, ACT, and Other Common Types

There are many different approaches to therapy. Here are some of the most effective ones for anxiety and depression.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
CBT focuses on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It helps you identify negative thinking patterns (like "I'm a failure") and challenge them with more realistic thoughts.

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
ACT teaches you to accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, while committing to actions that align with your values.

## Other Types
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: Focuses on improving relationships and social functioning.
- **Psychodynamic Therapy**: Explores how past experiences influence current behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> CBT is often considered the "gold standard" for treating anxiety and depression.
