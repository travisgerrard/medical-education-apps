# What to Expect in an Urgent Evaluation

Going to the emergency room (ER) or a crisis center for mental health can be intimidating. Knowing what to expect can help reduce the anxiety of the experience.

## Where to Go

- **Emergency Room (ER)**: Available 24/7 at most hospitals. Can handle medical emergencies and safety concerns.
- **Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU)**: Specialized facilities for mental health crises. Often quieter and more focused than an ER.
- **Urgent Care**: *Not recommended* for mental health crises, as they typically aren't equipped to handle safety assessments.

## The Process: Step-by-Step

### 1. Triage (The First Step)
When you arrive, you'll see a triage nurse. They will:
- Check your vital signs (blood pressure, pulse)
- Ask why you're there (be honest: "I'm feeling unsafe" or "I'm having suicidal thoughts")
- Determine how urgent your situation is

**Note**: You may have to wait. ERs prioritize life-threatening physical injuries (like heart attacks). Bring a book or something to distract you.

### 2. Medical Clearance
Before seeing a psychiatrist, an ER doctor may want to rule out physical causes. This might involve:
- Blood work
- Urine test
- Physical exam

### 3. The Psychiatric Assessment
A mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, or social worker) will talk to you. They will ask about:
- **Current Symptoms**: What is happening right now?
- **Safety**: Do you have a plan to hurt yourself? Do you have access to means (weapons, pills)?
- **History**: Have you felt this way before? Have you been hospitalized?
- **Substance Use**: Alcohol and drugs can affect your safety and treatment options.
- **Support System**: Who is at home? Do you have a therapist?

**Be Honest**: This is the most important part. They can only help if they know the truth.

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome A: Discharge to Outpatient Care
If the team determines you are safe to go home, they will:
- Help you schedule an appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist
- Create a **Safety Plan** with you
- Provide crisis numbers to call if things get worse
- Possibly prescribe short-term medication

### Outcome B: Voluntary Admission
If you need more intensive care to stay safe, they may recommend staying in the hospital.
- **"Voluntary"** means you agree to stay for treatment.
- You typically stay for 3-7 days for stabilization and medication adjustment.

### Outcome C: Involuntary Admission
If you are an immediate danger to yourself or others and refuse help, a doctor may require you to stay for safety.
- This is a legal process (often called a "hold").
- It is used only as a last resort to save a life.

## What to Bring (If You Have Time)
- **List of medications**
- **Insurance card**
- **Phone charger** (though you may not be allowed to keep your phone in some units)
- **Comfortable clothes** (without drawstrings)
- **Contact info** for your doctors and family

## Rights and Advocacy
- You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect.
- You can ask questions about your care plan.
- You can ask to have a support person with you during assessments (though policies vary).
