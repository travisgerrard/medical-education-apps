# Common Symptoms of Anxiety

Anxiety isn't just "worrying a lot." It affects both your mind and your body in very real, physical ways. Recognizing these symptoms is the first step in getting help.

## Emotional and Mental Symptoms

**Excessive, Uncontrollable Worry**
- Worrying about everyday events or problems that others don't find concerning
- The worry feels impossible to control or "turn off"
- Constantly expecting the worst to happen
- Example: Worrying for hours that you'll be fired even though your last performance review was excellent

**Restlessness and Feeling "Keyed Up"**
- Feeling like you can't sit still or relax
- Inner sense of tension or being on edge
- Difficulty unwinding at the end of the day

**Irritability**
- Becoming easily annoyed or frustrated
- Snapping at loved ones over small things
- Having a "short fuse" that wasn't there before

**Sense of Impending Doom or Dread**
- Persistent feeling that "something bad" is about to happen
- Difficulty identifying what you're afraid of
- Constantly scanning for danger or threats

**Difficulty Concentrating**
- Mind going blank during conversations
- Trouble remembering what you just read
- Difficulty making even simple decisions

## Physical Symptoms

Anxiety causes very real physical sensations because your body's "fight or flight" response is activated:

**Muscle Tension**
- Tightness in your neck, shoulders, jaw, or back
- Clenching your teeth, especially at night
- Tension headaches

**Rapid Heart Rate**
- Heart racing or pounding
- Palpitations (awareness of your heartbeat)
- Chest tightness or discomfort

**Breathing Changes**
- Shortness of breath or feeling "air hungry"
- Breathing too fast (hyperventilation)
- Sensation of not being able to take a deep breath

**Fatigue**
- Feeling exhausted even after a full night's sleep
- Anxiety is mentally and physically draining

**Sleep Problems**
- Trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts
- Waking up multiple times during the night
- Waking early and being unable to fall back asleep

**Gastrointestinal Issues**
- Nausea or "butterflies" in your stomach
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms

**Other Physical Symptoms**
- Sweating (especially palms or underarms)
- Trembling or shaking
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Frequent urination
- Dry mouth

## How Severe Are Your Symptoms?

**Mild Anxiety**
- Symptoms are noticeable but don't significantly interfere with daily life
- You can still function at work, school, and in relationships

**Moderate Anxiety**
- Symptoms interfere with some activities
- You may avoid certain situations or need extra effort to complete tasks

**Severe Anxiety**
- Symptoms significantly impact your daily life
- You may avoid social situations, struggle at work, or have difficulty leaving home

## When to Seek Help

You don't have to wait until symptoms are "severe" to get help. Consider talking to a healthcare provider if:
- Anxiety interferes with work, school, or relationships
- You're avoiding activities you used to enjoy
- Physical symptoms are concerning or affecting your quality of life
- You're using alcohol or drugs to cope
- Anxiety symptoms have lasted more than a few weeks

> Physical symptoms are real, not "all in your head." Treating the underlying anxiety often resolves the physical discomfort.
