# How Falls Are Evaluated

Healthcare providers use specific tests and questions to assess your fall risk and create a personalized prevention plan.

## When to Get Evaluated

You should have a fall risk assessment if you:
- Have fallen in the past year
- Feel unsteady when walking or standing
- Worry about falling
- Are 65 or older (ask your doctor about annual screening)

## Fall Risk Assessment Components

### Medical History
Your provider will ask about:
- Previous falls: How many? When? Where? Were you injured?
- Current medications (including over-the-counter)
- Chronic health conditions
- Recent hospitalizations
- Dizziness, fainting, or near-falls
- Vision or hearing problems

### Physical Examination

**Vision Check**
- Visual acuity test
- Depth perception
- Peripheral vision

**Feet and Footwear**
- Check for foot problems, numbness, or pain
- Evaluate your shoes
- Test sensation in feet

**Blood Pressure**
- Sitting and standing measurements
- Check for postural hypotension (drop when standing)

### Functional Tests

**Gait Assessment** (How You Walk)
- Watch your walking speed and pattern
- Observe arm swing and foot clearance
- Check for shuffling or hesitation

**Balance Tests**
- Stand with feet together, eyes closed
- One-leg stand
- Sit-to-stand test (get up from chair without using arms)

**Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test**
- Stand from a chair
- Walk 10 feet
- Turn around
- Walk back and sit down

**Result**: Taking more than 12 seconds suggests increased fall risk

### Strength Testing
- Leg strength (important for catching yourself)
- Grip strength
- Core stability

## Home Safety Evaluation

Some healthcare providers offer home visits to:
- Identify hazards in your living space
- Recommend specific modifications
- Assess lighting and flooring

## Medication Review

Your provider will:
- List all medications (prescription and over-the-counter)
- Identify those that increase fall risk
- Discuss alternatives or dose adjustments
- Check for drug interactions

## Creating Your Prevention Plan

Based on the evaluation, your provider will recommend:
- Specific exercises for strength and balance
- Vision or hearing care
- Medication changes
- Home safety modifications
- Assistive devices if needed
- Physical therapy referral

## Follow-Up

Fall risk isn't static—it changes over time. You should:
- Discuss falls at every doctor visit
- Report near-falls or changes in balance
- Reassess if you start new medications
- Repeat evaluation annually

## What to Bring to Your Appointment

- List of all medications (or bring the bottles)
- Details about any recent falls
- Questions about your specific concerns
- A family member if helpful

## Remember

A thorough fall risk evaluation helps identify your specific risks so you can target the right interventions. Don't hesitate to ask for this assessment—preventing falls is an important part of healthy aging.
