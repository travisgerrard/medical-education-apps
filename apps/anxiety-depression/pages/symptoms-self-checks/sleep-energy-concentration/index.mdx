# Sleep, Energy, and Concentration

Anxiety and depression often disrupt your body's natural rhythms.

## Sleep
- **Insomnia**: Trouble falling asleep or waking up too early is common in depression.
- **Racing Thoughts**: Anxiety can keep your mind active at night, preventing rest.
- **Oversleeping**: Some people with depression sleep excessively as an escape.

## Energy
- **Fatigue**: Both conditions can drain your energy, making even small tasks feel exhausting.
- **"Lead" Feeling**: Depression can make your limbs feel heavy.

## Concentration
- **Brain Fog**: Difficulty focusing, making decisions, or remembering things.
- **Distraction**: Anxiety can make it hard to stay on task because of constant worry.
