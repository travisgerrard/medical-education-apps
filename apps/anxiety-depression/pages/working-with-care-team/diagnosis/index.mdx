# How Clinicians Diagnose Anxiety and Depression

Unlike many medical conditions, there's no blood test, brain scan, or lab work that can diagnose depression or anxiety. Diagnosis is based on a careful review of your symptoms, medical history, and how symptoms affect your life. Understanding this process can help you know what to expect and how to prepare.

## Why There's No "Test" for Depression or Anxiety

**Mental health conditions are diagnosed clinically**, meaning diagnosis is based on:
- **Your reported symptoms** (what you tell your provider)
- **Observable signs** (what your provider notices about your behavior, mood, appearance)
- **Duration and severity** (how long symptoms have lasted and how much they interfere with your life)
- **Ruling out other causes** (medical conditions that can mimic mental health symptoms)

**The science**: While brain imaging and genetic research are advancing, we don't yet have reliable biomarkers (objective tests) for most mental health conditions. Diagnosis remains a clinical assessment.

## The Diagnostic Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Symptom Review

Your provider will ask detailed questions about what you're experiencing:

**For Depression**:
- Do you feel sad, empty, or hopeless most days?
- Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?
- How is your sleep? (sleeping too much or can't fall asleep/stay asleep?)
- How is your appetite and weight? (eating too much, too little, weight changes?)
- How is your energy level? (exhausted, hard to get out of bed?)
- Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?
- Do you feel worthless or excessively guilty?
- Are you moving or speaking more slowly than usual?
- Have you thought about death or hurting yourself?

**For Anxiety**:
- Do you worry excessively about different things?
- Is the worry hard to control?
- Do you feel restless, on edge, or keyed up?
- Are you easily fatigued?
- Do you have trouble concentrating?
- Are you more irritable than usual?
- Do you have muscle tension?
- Do you have trouble sleeping?
- Do you have panic attacks?
- Do you avoid situations because of anxiety?

### Step 2: Duration Assessment

**How long have you felt this way?**

**For Depression**: Symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, for **at least 2 weeks** to meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.

**For Generalized Anxiety**: Excessive worry must be present more days than not for **at least 6 months**.

**Why this matters**: Everyone has bad days or stressful weeks. Mental health diagnoses require persistent symptoms over time.

### Step 3: Severity and Impact

**How much do symptoms interfere with your life?**

Your provider will assess:
- Can you work or go to school?
- Can you take care of yourself (shower, eat, pay bills)?
- Can you maintain relationships?
- Do you avoid activities because of symptoms?
- Has your functioning declined from your baseline?

**Severity levels**:
- **Mild**: Some interference, but you're mostly functioning
- **Moderate**: Significant interference with work, school, or relationships
- **Severe**: Major impairment, can't function normally

### Step 4: Medical History and Physical Causes

**Ruling out other explanations**:

Many medical conditions can cause symptoms that look like depression or anxiety:

| Medical Condition | Symptoms That Mimic Mental Health |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Thyroid disorders** | Fatigue, mood changes, weight changes |
| **Anemia** | Fatigue, difficulty concentrating |
| **Vitamin D or B12 deficiency** | Low mood, fatigue |
| **Sleep apnea** | Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability |
| **Diabetes** | Fatigue, mood swings |
| **Heart disease** | Anxiety, panic-like symptoms |
| **Chronic pain** | Low mood, sleep problems, fatigue |

**What your provider may do**:
- Review medications (some drugs can cause depression/anxiety)
- Order blood work (thyroid, vitamin levels, blood count)
- Ask about substance use (alcohol, drugs can worsen symptoms)
- Review recent life events (grief, major stress)

### Step 5: Family and Personal History

Your provider will ask:
- Have you experienced depression or anxiety before?
- Do mental health conditions run in your family?
- Have you had trauma or adverse childhood experiences?
- Have you tried treatment before? Did it help?

**Why this matters**: Genetics play a role in mental health. A family history can increase risk and inform treatment.

## Standardized Screening Tools

### PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)

**What it is**: A 9-question, validated screening tool for depression. You rate how often you've experienced specific symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

**Questions include**:
- Little interest or pleasure in doing things
- Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless
- Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
- Feeling tired or having little energy
- Changes in appetite
- Feeling bad about yourself
- Trouble concentrating
- Moving/speaking slowly or being fidgety/restless
- Thoughts of self-harm

**Scoring**:
- **0-4**: Minimal depression
- **5-9**: Mild depression
- **10-14**: Moderate depression
- **15-19**: Moderately severe depression
- **20-27**: Severe depression

**What it means**: The score helps quantify severity and track progress over time, but it doesn't diagnose alone. Your provider uses it alongside clinical judgment.

### GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7)

**What it is**: A 7-question screening tool for anxiety. You rate how often you've experienced symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

**Questions include**:
- Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge
- Not being able to stop or control worrying
- Worrying too much about different things
- Trouble relaxing
- Being so restless it's hard to sit still
- Becoming easily annoyed or irritable
- Feeling afraid, as if something awful might happen

**Scoring**:
- **0-4**: Minimal anxiety
- **5-9**: Mild anxiety
- **10-14**: Moderate anxiety
- **15-21**: Severe anxiety

### Other Screening Tools

- **PHQ-2**: A quick 2-question screen for depression (often used first)
- **PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)**: Measures stress levels
- **PTSD Checklist**: If trauma is suspected
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire**: If bipolar disorder is suspected

## Differential Diagnosis: What Else Could It Be?

Your provider will consider other conditions that can present similarly:

### Bipolar Disorder

**Key difference**: Bipolar disorder involves episodes of mania or hypomania (elevated mood, increased energy, risky behavior), not just depression.

**Why it matters**: Treatment for bipolar disorder is different. Antidepressants alone can trigger manic episodes in people with bipolar.

**Red flags**: History of manic episodes, family history of bipolar, depression that doesn't respond to typical treatment.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

**Key features**: Intrusive memories of trauma, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance of reminders, hypervigilance.

**Why it matters**: PTSD requires trauma-focused therapy (like EMDR or trauma-focused CBT).

### Adjustment Disorder

**Key difference**: Symptoms develop in response to a specific stressful event (job loss, divorce, move) and improve once the stressor is removed or you adapt.

**Why it matters**: May not require long-term treatment.

### Substance-Induced Mood/Anxiety Disorder

**Key question**: Are your symptoms caused by or worsened by alcohol or drug use?

**Why it matters**: Addressing substance use is often the first step before treating underlying mental health conditions.

### Personality Disorders

**Examples**: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) can involve mood instability and anxiety.

**Why it matters**: Requires specialized therapy (like DBT for BPD).

## What Happens After Diagnosis?

### You'll Discuss Treatment Options

Based on your diagnosis and severity, your provider will recommend:
- **Therapy** (types, frequency)
- **Medication** (options, risks, benefits)
- **Lifestyle changes** (exercise, sleep hygiene, stress management)
- **Combination approaches** (often most effective)

### You'll Create a Treatment Plan

Together, you'll decide:
- What treatment to try first
- How you'll track progress
- When to follow up
- What to do if symptoms worsen
- Safety plan (if needed)

### You'll Set Follow-Up Appointments

**Typical schedule**:
- **If starting medication**: Follow-up in 2-4 weeks to assess side effects and response
- **If starting therapy**: Weekly or biweekly sessions
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regular check-ins to track progress

## Common Concerns About Diagnosis

### "What if they think I'm faking it?"

Providers are trained to recognize genuine symptoms. If you're experiencing distress, it's real, and it deserves treatment.

### "What if I don't meet criteria for a diagnosis?"

You can still benefit from treatment even if you don't meet full diagnostic criteria. Subthreshold symptoms (symptoms that cause distress but don't fully meet criteria) are still worth addressing.

### "Will this go on my permanent record?"

Medical records are confidential. Mental health diagnoses are protected under HIPAA. They won't appear on background checks or affect most employment (with rare exceptions like certain military or security clearances).

### "What if they diagnose me with something I don't have?"

Diagnosis is not always perfect on the first visit. If treatment isn't working or you disagree with the diagnosis, speak up. You can seek a second opinion.

### "Can I disagree with the diagnosis?"

Yes. You're an active participant in your care. If you don't feel the diagnosis fits, discuss it with your provider. Diagnosis can also change over time as more information is gathered.

## How to Prepare for a Diagnostic Evaluation

**Bring**:
- List of current symptoms and when they started
- List of medications and supplements
- Family history of mental health conditions
- Previous treatment history (what you've tried, what helped)
- Questions you want to ask

**Be honest**:
- About substance use
- About suicidal thoughts
- About symptoms (don't downplay or exaggerate)
- About how much symptoms affect your life

**Ask questions**:
- "Why do you think I have [diagnosis]?"
- "What are other possibilities?"
- "How did you rule out [other condition]?"
- "What's the best treatment for this?"
