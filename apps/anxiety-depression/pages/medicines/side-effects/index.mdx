# Side Effects: What Is Common and What Is Serious

All medications can cause side effects. Knowing what to expect helps you stay on track with treatment.

## Common Side Effects (Usually Mild and Temporary)
- **Nausea**: Often goes away after the first week
- **Headache**: Usually mild
- **Drowsiness or Insomnia**: May improve over time
- **Dry Mouth**: Drinking water helps
- **Sexual Side Effects**: Decreased libido or difficulty with orgasm (20-30% of patients)

## Less Common but Manageable
- **Weight Changes**: Some people gain or lose weight
- **Increased Anxiety**: May occur in the first week (usually improves)

## Serious Side Effects (Rare but Important)
- **Suicidal Thoughts**: Especially in people under 25. The FDA requires a black box warning about this risk.[^1][^2] Contact your doctor immediately if this occurs.
- **Serotonin Syndrome**: Confusion, fever, rapid heart rate. Seek emergency care.
- **Severe Allergic Reaction**: Rash, swelling, difficulty breathing. Call 911.

## Important Safety Note on Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines (like Xanax, Ativan) carry risks of:
- Dependence and withdrawal
- Cognitive impairment
- Increased fall risk, especially in older adults[^3]

NICE guidelines recommend against long-term benzodiazepine use for anxiety.[^4]
