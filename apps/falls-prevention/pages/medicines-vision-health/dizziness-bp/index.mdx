# Dizziness and Blood Pressure

Dizziness and blood pressure problems are common fall causes. Understanding and managing them can significantly reduce your risk.

## Types of Dizziness

### Lightheadedness
**Feels like**: Might faint, woozy
**Common causes**: Low blood pressure, dehydration, medications
**Fall risk**: High when sudden

### Vertigo
**Feels like**: Room spinning
**Common causes**: Inner ear problems (BPPV, Meniere's)
**Fall risk**: Very high during episodes

### Disequilibrium
**Feels like**: Unsteady, off-balance
**Common causes**: Multiple system problems
**Fall risk**: Persistent risk

## Orthostatic Hypotension (Postural Blood Pressure Drop)

**What happens:**
- Blood pressure drops when standing
- Brain briefly gets less blood
- Causes dizziness, lightheadedness
- Vision may dim

**Numbers:**
- Drop of 20+ points systolic OR
- Drop of 10+ points diastolic
- Within 3 minutes of standing

**Causes:**
- Dehydration
- Blood pressure medications
- Prolonged bed rest
- Parkinson's disease
- Diabetes

### Prevention Strategies

**Stand up slowly:**
1. Sit on edge of bed/chair for 30 seconds
2. Then stand slowly
3. Hold onto something
4. Wait before walking

**Hydration:**
- Drink 6-8 glasses water daily
- More in hot weather
- Avoid excessive caffeine/alcohol

**Compression stockings:**
- Help blood return from legs
- Especially helpful in morning
- Get proper fit

**Medication timing:**
- Don't take blood pressure meds at bedtime
- Discuss timing with doctor
- May need dose adjustment

**Other strategies:**
- Sleep with head slightly elevated
- Flex ankles before standing
- Eat small, frequent meals
- Avoid hot showers

## Blood Pressure Management

### Too Low
**Symptoms:**
- Dizziness when standing
- Fatigue
- Blurry vision
- Weakness

**Causes:**
- Medications (most common)
- Dehydration
- Heart problems
- Endocrine disorders

### Too High
**Why it matters for falls:**
- Medications to treat it can cause low BP
- May affect blood flow to brain
- Increases stroke risk

**Target**: Generally 130/80 or less, but individualized for older adults

## Medication-Related Dizziness

**High-risk medications:**
- Blood pressure medications (especially multiple)
- Diuretics
- Sedatives/sleep aids
- Antidepressants

**What to do:**
- Report dizziness immediately
- Don't stop medications on your own
- Doctor may adjust dose or timing
- Sometimes switching medications helps

## When Dizziness Is Dangerous

**Call 911 if dizziness with:**
- Chest pain
- Severe headache
- Weakness on one side
- Slurred speech
- Difficulty walking
- Loss of consciousness

**See doctor soon if:**
- New or worsening dizziness
- Frequent episodes
- Affects daily activities
- After medication change

## BPPV (Benign Positional Vertigo)

**Most common cause of vertigo**

**Symptoms:**
- Brief spinning with position changes
- Rolling over in bed
- Looking up
- Bending over

**Treatment:**
- Epley maneuver (simple procedure)
- Very effective
- Physical therapy
- Often resolves in weeks

## Testing and Evaluation

**Your doctor may:**
- Check blood pressure lying and standing
- Review medications
- Blood tests (anemia, thyroid)
- Heart rhythm check
- Balance testing
- Vestibular testing if indicated

## Self-Monitoring

**Keep a diary:**
- When dizziness occurs
- What you were doing
- How long it lasted
- Associated symptoms
- Recent meals/medications

**Check your blood pressure:**
- Home monitor ($30-60)
- Sitting and standing
- Same time each day
- Bring log to appointments

## Diet and Hydration

**Helpful strategies:**
- Adequate salt (unless restricted)
- Small, frequent meals
- Avoid alcohol
- Limit caffeine
- Stay hydrated

**Avoid:**
- Skipping meals
- Standing long periods
- Hot baths/showers
- Large, carbohydrate-heavy meals

## Remember

Dizziness is never normal and always warrants evaluation. Most causes are treatable.

Simple position changes done slowly can prevent many dizzy-related falls.

If you're dizzy, don't try to "push through it"—sit or lie down immediately and call for help if needed.

Work with your doctor to find the right balance with blood pressure medications—too low is as dangerous as too high.
