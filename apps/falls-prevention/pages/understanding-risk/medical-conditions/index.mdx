# Medical Conditions That Increase Risk

Several health conditions affect your balance, strength, or awareness, increasing the likelihood of falls. Understanding these helps you work with your healthcare team.

## Neurological Conditions

### Parkinson's Disease
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Shuffling gait and slow movements
- Reduced arm swing when walking
- Difficulty initiating movement
- "Freezing" episodes
- Postural instability

**Prevention strategies:**
- Physical therapy focusing on gait
- Medications timed appropriately
- Clearing wide walking paths
- Using assistive devices correctly

### Stroke
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Weakness on one side of body
- Balance and coordination problems
- Vision changes
- Difficulty judging distances
- Reduced awareness of affected side

**Important**: Fall risk is highest in the first 6 months after stroke.

### Peripheral Neuropathy
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Numbness in feet ("can't feel the ground")
- Reduced ability to detect texture changes
- Pain or burning sensations
- Difficulty knowing foot position without looking

**Common causes**: Diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, alcohol use

## Cardiovascular Conditions

### Postural Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure When Standing)
**What happens:**
- Blood pressure drops when you stand up
- Causes dizziness, lightheadedness
- Vision may briefly dim
- May feel like you'll faint

**Risk factors:**
- Dehydration
- Blood pressure medications
- Prolonged bed rest
- Hot weather

**Prevention:**
- Stand up slowly (sit for a moment first)
- Avoid sudden position changes
- Stay hydrated
- Review medications with doctor

### Heart Arrhythmias
**How they increase fall risk:**
- Irregular heartbeat reduces blood flow to brain
- Can cause sudden dizziness
- May lead to fainting (syncope)
- Creates unpredictable symptoms

### Heart Failure
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Fatigue and weakness
- Shortness of breath limits activity
- Fluid buildup affects balance
- Medications (diuretics) may cause dizziness

## Musculoskeletal Conditions

### Arthritis
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Joint pain limits movement
- Stiffness, especially in morning
- Reduced range of motion
- Unstable or "giving way" joints
- Difficulty with stairs

**Most problematic**: Arthritis in hips, knees, and ankles

### Osteoporosis
**Important note**: Osteoporosis doesn't directly cause falls, but:
- Makes fractures more likely if you do fall
- Hip fractures are especially dangerous
- Fear of fracture may reduce activity
- Less activity leads to weaker muscles

## Vision and Ear Conditions

### Cataracts
**How they increase fall risk:**
- Blurry or cloudy vision
- Difficulty seeing in bright light
- Poor night vision
- Double vision
- Cannot judge distances accurately

**Good news**: Cataract surgery significantly reduces fall risk.

### Glaucoma
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Peripheral vision loss ("tunnel vision")
- Can't see obstacles to the side
- Difficulty adapting to light changes
- May not notice hazards

### Macular Degeneration
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Central vision loss
- Difficulty recognizing faces or reading
- Poor depth perception
- Can't see details like step edges

### Vestibular Disorders (Inner Ear)
**How they increase fall risk:**
- Vertigo (room spinning sensation)
- Dizziness and unsteadiness
- Nausea making it hard to focus
- Difficulty walking in dark

**Common conditions**: BPPV (benign positional vertigo), Meniere's disease

## Metabolic and Endocrine Conditions

### Diabetes
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Peripheral neuropathy (foot numbness)
- Vision problems (retinopathy)
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) causes weakness, confusion
- Poor circulation affects healing

**Prevention**: Tight blood sugar control reduces complications

### Thyroid Disorders
**Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid):**
- Muscle weakness
- Rapid heartbeat
- Tremor

**Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid):**
- Fatigue and slow movements
- Balance problems
- Muscle weakness

## Cognitive and Mental Health Conditions

### Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease
**How they increase fall risk:**
- Poor judgment about safety
- Difficulty recognizing hazards
- Vision-spatial problems
- Wandering or pacing
- Forgetting to use assistive devices

### Depression
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Reduced energy and motivation
- Difficulty concentrating
- Medications (see separate lesson)
- Less physical activity
- May not care about safety

### Anxiety
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Fear of falling becomes excessive
- Muscle tension affects balance
- Medications may cause drowsiness
- Avoiding activity leads to deconditioning

## Respiratory Conditions

### COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
**How it increases fall risk:**
- Shortness of breath limits activity
- Reduced exercise tolerance
- Muscle wasting from inactivity
- Using  oxygen tubing creates trip hazard

## Multiple Conditions

**Critical fact**: Having multiple chronic conditions dramatically increases fall risk because:
- Effects combine and compound
- More medications needed
- Overall frailty increases
- Each condition limits function differently

## Working with Your Healthcare Team

### Important Questions to Ask:
1. How does this condition affect my fall risk?
2. What symptoms should I immediately report?
3. Are there treatments that reduce fall risk?
4. Should I see a specialist?
5. Are my medications contributing to falls?

### When to Get Evaluated:
- New diagnosis of any condition above
- Worsening of existing condition
- New or changing symptoms
- After any fall

## What You Can Do

**For each condition you have:**
- Understand how it affects balance
- Follow treatment plans carefully
- Report new or worsening symptoms
- Ask about fall prevention strategies specific to your condition
- Consider physical therapy

**General strategies:**
- Keep all medical appointments
- Take medications as prescribed
- Stay as active as safely possible
- Use assistive devices recommended
- Modify your home environment

## Remember

Having a medical condition that increases fall risk doesn't mean falls are inevitable. With proper management and targeted prevention, you can stay safe and independent.
