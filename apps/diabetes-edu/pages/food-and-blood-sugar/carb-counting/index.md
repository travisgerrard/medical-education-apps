# Carbohydrate “Carb” Counting

<img src={carbCounting01} />

Our bodies need a certain amount of carbohydrate for energy every day.

> Did you know that our brains and central nervous systems run primarily on glucose?

Meal planning with carb counting is another type of meal planning done by adding up how many total grams of carbohydrates you are eating at a meal or snack. It is also important to eat on time and have the right portions of carbohydrate when you are taking medications for blood sugar management. Your dietitian or diabetes educator can help teach you the right amount for your body and energy needs.

### One “carb” choice or serving has 15 grams of total carbohydrate

# How to understand the Nutrition Facts Label

You can also see how many grams of carbohydrates are in a food by looking at the serving size or by looking at a nutrition food label.

The total amount of carbohydrate (listed in grams) is for all starches, dietary fiber, total sugars (including added sugar) and sugar alcohols that are in one serving of this food.

<img src={carbCounting02} />

See the “conversion guide” below. As an example, this food item has 37 grams of total carbohydrate or 2 ½ carbohydrate choices.

<blockquote>
<div>
  <table style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style={{paddingLeft: '25px', paddingRight: '25px'}}>Total carbohydrate grams</th>
        <th style={{paddingLeft: '25px', paddingRight: '25px'}}>Number of carbohydrate choices</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0 to 5</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6 to 10</td>
        <td>½</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11 to 20</td>
        <td>1</td>
