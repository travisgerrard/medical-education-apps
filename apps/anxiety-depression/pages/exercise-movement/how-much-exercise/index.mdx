# How Much Exercise Is Enough to Help Mood

You don't need to run marathons. Moderate amounts of exercise can make a big difference.

## Evidence-Based Guidelines
- **For Depression**: 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise (like brisk walking)
- **For Anxiety**: Even 10-15 minutes can help reduce acute anxiety

## Breaking It Down
- **30 minutes, 5 days a week**: The classic recommendation
- **OR 50 minutes, 3 days a week**: Fewer but longer sessions
- **OR 10-minute bursts**: Three 10-minute walks throughout the day work too!

## Start Small
If you haven't been active:
- Week 1: 10 minutes, 3 times
- Week 2-3: 15 minutes, 3-4 times  
- Week 4+: 20-30 minutes, 4-5 times

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some exercise is always better than none. Even a 10-minute walk can improve your mood.
