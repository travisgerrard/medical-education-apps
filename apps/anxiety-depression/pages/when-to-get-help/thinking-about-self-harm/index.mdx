## Understanding Suicidal Thoughts

### You Are Not Alone

- About **12 million** adults in the U.S. have serious thoughts of suicide each year
- Many people experience these thoughts during depression, anxiety, trauma, or overwhelming life stress
- Having these thoughts does not make you weak, selfish, or broken
- These thoughts are a symptom of emotional pain that has become unbearable—they are not a character flaw

### Thoughts Are Not the Same as Actions

**Important distinction**: Having thoughts about suicide does not mean you will act on them. There is a space between the thought and the action, and that space is where help can reach you.

Many people have these thoughts and, with support and treatment, go on to live full, meaningful lives.

### What These Thoughts Often Really Mean

When you think "I want to die," what you often really mean is:
- "I want this pain to stop"
- "I can't see a way out of this situation"
- "I feel like a burden to everyone"
- "I'm exhausted and don't know how to keep going"

**These are understandable feelings when you're suffering**. But there are other ways to address them besides ending your life. Treatment can help.

## Immediate Steps to Stay Safe

### 1. Remove Access to Means

**This is critical**: When in crisis, impulsive actions can be deadly. Remove access to:
- **Firearms**: Give them to a trusted friend or family member, or contact law enforcement for safe storage
- **Medications**: Give all pills (prescription and over-the-counter) to someone else to hold
- **Sharp objects**: Knives, razors, scissors
- **Anything else you've thought about using**

**Why this matters**: Most suicide attempts are impulsive (happen within 10 minutes of the decision). Creating a barrier—even a small one—can save your life.

### 2. Delay and Distract

**Make a deal with yourself**: "I will not act on these thoughts for the next 24 hours."

If 24 hours feels impossible, try:
- The next hour
- The next 30 minutes
- The next 5 minutes

**During this time, distract yourself**:
- Call someone (even just to chat about nothing)
- Watch a comforting TV show or movie
- Listen to music
- Go for a walk (in a safe, public place)
- Take a shower
- Pet an animal
- Do something with your hands (draw, clean, organize)

**The goal**: Get through this moment. Suicidal crises are intense but temporary. If you can ride out the wave, the intensity will decrease.

### 3. Connect with Another Person

**Isolation makes everything worse**. Reach out:
- Call a friend or family member (you don't have to tell them everything—just connect)
- Call 988 or text 741741 to talk to a trained crisis counselor
- Go to a public place (coffee shop, library) to be around people
- Post in an online support community
- Call your therapist's emergency line

**What to say if you're scared to tell someone**:
- "I'm having a really hard time and need support"
- "I'm not feeling safe and need someone to talk to"
- "I'm in crisis—can you stay with me?"

### 4. Use a Safety Plan

A safety plan is a written, personalized list of coping strategies and resources you can use in a crisis. If you don't have one, create one now:

**My Safety Plan** (fill this out when you're calm, keep it accessible):

1. **Warning signs I'm entering a crisis**:
   - (e.g., "I stop eating," "I isolate from friends," "I can't sleep")

2. **Things I can do to distract myself**:
   - (e.g., "Call my sister," "Watch my favorite show," "Go for a walk")

3. **People I can reach out to**:
   - Name: _____________ Phone: _____________
   - Name: _____________ Phone: _____________

4. **Professional resources**:
   - Therapist: _____________ Phone: _____________
   - Crisis Line: 988
   - Emergency Room: _____________

5. **Reasons I want to keep living** (even small ones count):
   - (e.g., "My dog needs me," "I want to see what happens next," "I want to travel someday")

## Why Suicidal Thoughts Happen

### Depression Lies

Depression distorts your thinking. It tells you:
- "Nothing will ever get better"
- "Everyone would be better off without you"
- "You're a burden"
- "There's no other way"

**These are lies**. They feel true, but they are symptoms of depression, not reality.

### Tunnel Vision

When you're in a crisis, your brain can only see one way out. This is called "tunnel vision" or "cognitive constriction." It's a symptom, not reality. There are other options—you just can't see them right now because of the pain.

### Hopelessness is a Symptom

Feeling hopeless is one of the core symptoms of depression. It is not a reflection of your actual situation or future. With treatment, hopelessness lifts, often dramatically.

## Treatment Works

**The most important thing to know: Suicidal thoughts are treatable**.

With the right help, most people who have been suicidal go on to feel better. Treatment options:
- **Therapy** (especially CBT, DBT, and safety planning interventions)
- **Medication** (antidepressants can reduce suicidal thoughts)
- **Inpatient care** (if you need intensive support to stay safe)
- **Crisis stabilization programs** (short-term intensive outpatient programs)

**Recovery is possible**. Many people who have felt this way describe later being glad they didn't act on the thoughts.

## Long-Term: Building a Life Worth Living

Once the crisis passes, work with a therapist on:
- **Identifying triggers** for suicidal thoughts
- **Building coping skills** for emotional pain
- **Addressing underlying issues** (trauma, chronic stress, relationship problems)
- **Creating meaning and connection** in your life
- **Managing mental health conditions** that contribute to suicidal thoughts
