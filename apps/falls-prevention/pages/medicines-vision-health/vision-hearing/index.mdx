# Vision and Hearing

Good vision and hearing are essential for balance and fall prevention. Regular check-ups and proper correction can significantly reduce fall risk.

## Vision and Falls

**Why vision matters:**
- Sees obstacles and hazards
- Judges distances and depth
- Detects changes in surface
- Helps brain understand body position

**Statistics**: Vision problems **double** fall risk.

## Common Vision Problems

### Cataracts
- Cloudy lens
- Blurry vision
- Difficulty with glare
- Poor night vision
- **Surgery reduces fall risk by 30%**

### Glaucoma
- Peripheral vision loss
- Can't see obstacles to side
- Often no symptoms until advanced
- **Regular screening critical** (annual eye exams)

### Macular Degeneration
- Central vision loss
- Difficulty seeing details
- Poor depth perception
- Can't see step edges clearly

### Diabetic Retinopathy
- From diabetes
- Vision changes
- Can lead to blindness
- **Tight blood sugar control prevents**

## Vision Care

**Annual eye exams essential for those over 60**

**Update prescriptions:**
- Changes can be gradual (you adapt without realizing)
- Outdated glasses increase fall risk
- Check prescription annually

**Bifocals and multifocals:**
- Can distort vision on stairs
- Consider separate reading/distance glasses
- Single-vision distance glasses for walking outdoors

**Lighting:**
- Aging eyes need 2-3x more light
- Eliminate glare
- Use task lighting

**After eye procedures:**
- Be extra careful during adjustment period
- Use railings
- Avoid stairs if vision blurry

## Hearing and Balance

**The connection:**
- Inner ear controls balance
- Hearing loss may indicate balance system problems
- Can't hear environmental cues
- May not hear someone warning about hazard

**Hearing loss increases fall risk by 30-140%** (depending on severity).

### Common Causes
- Age-related hearing loss
- Ear infections
- Earwax buildup (simple fix!)
- Meniere's disease
- Inner ear disorders

## Vestibular Disorders

**Inner ear problems:**
- BPPV (benign positional vertigo)
- Vestibular neuritis
- Labyrinth itis

**Symptoms:**
- Room spinning
- Severe dizziness
- Nausea
- Balance problems

**Treatment:**
- Vestibular rehabilitation therapy
- Epley maneuver for BPPV
- Medications
- Balance retraining

## Hearing Aids

**Benefits beyond hearing:**
- May improve balance
- Better environmental awareness
- Reduces isolation
- Improves safety

**Getting help:**
- Audiologist evaluation
- Modern aids are discreet
- Insurance may cover (check benefits)
- Start with one ear if cost prohibitive

## Regular Screenings

**Vision:**
- Age 60+: Annual comprehensive eye exam
- With diabetes: Annual dilated exam
- If vision changes: Immediate exam

**Hearing:**
- Baseline at age 50
- Every 3 years if normal
- Annually if problems noted

## When to seek help immediately

**Vision:**
- Sudden vision loss
- Flashes of light
- New floaters
- Eye pain
- Double vision

**Hearing/Balance:**
- Sudden hearing loss
- Severe dizziness
- Room spinning
- Unsteady gait
- Falls

## Remember

Regular vision and hearing care are simple, effective fall prevention strategies. Don't accept decline as "normal aging"—many problems are treatable.

Annual exams detect problems early when treatment is most effective.
