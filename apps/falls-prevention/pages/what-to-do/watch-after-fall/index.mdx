# What to Watch for After a Fall

Even if you feel fine immediately after a fall, some injuries and complications appear hours or days later. Knowing what to watch for can save your life.

## First 24-48 Hours: Critical Watch Period

### Head Injury Symptoms (Can Be Delayed)

**Watch for:**
- Worsening headache
- Increasing confusion
- Nausea or vomiting
- Drowsiness or difficulty staying awake
- Slurred speech
- Vision changes
- Unequal pupil size
- Clear fluid from nose/ears
- Personality changes

**Especially concerning if:**
- You're on blood thinners
- Hit your head (even without losing consciousness)
- Age 65+

**Action**: Call 911 or go to ER immediately

### Fractures That Aren't Obvious

**Hip fractures** can sometimes be walked on initially:
- Pain that worsens over hours
- Groin or thigh pain
- Difficulty bearing weight
- Shortened or rotated leg

**Wrist/arm fractures:**
- Increasing swelling
- Can't use hand normally
- Severe pain with movement

**Rib fractures:**
- Pain with deep breathing
- Pain that worsens
- Shortness of breath

**Action**: See doctor same day or go to ER

### Internal Bleeding

**Particularly if on blood thinners:**
- Increasing bruising
- Bruises appearing in new locations
- Unusual bruise colors (very dark)
- Swelling
- Lightheadedness
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion

**Action**: Call doctor immediately or go to ER

## Days to Weeks After Fall

### Delayed Pain
**New or worsening pain days later:**
- Muscle soreness normal for 2-3 days
- Pain increasing past day 3 = problem
- New pain appearing

**Action**: Call doctor

### Reduced Mobility
**Difficulty returning to normal function:**
- Still limping after 3 days
- Can't do usual activities
- Range of motion limited
- Weakness persisting

**Action**: Request physical therapy evaluation

### Psychological Effects

**Common after falls:**
- Fear of falling again
- Anxiety about activities
- Avoiding movements
- Social withdrawal
- Depression

**Action**: Tell doctor—these are treatable

## Normal vs. Concerning

### Normal After a Fall
- Soreness for 2-3 days
- Minor bruising
- Feeling shaken up
- Mild stiffness
- Fatigue for a day

### NOT Normal
- Increasing pain
- Swelling that worsens
- New symptoms appearing
- Can't return to normal activities in 3-5 days
- Ongoing fear limiting life

## Specific Conditions to Monitor

### If You Have Osteoporosis
**Higher fracture risk:**
- Even "small" falls can cause fractures
- Compression fractures may not be obvious
- Back pain could indicate vertebral fracture

**Watch for:**
- New or worsening back pain
- Height loss
- Stooped posture
- Difficulty breathing (if rib fracture)

### If You Take Blood Thinners

**Warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, Pradaxa:**

**Extra vigilance needed:**
- Bleeding can be delayed
- Bruising develops more easily
- Brain bleeding may not show symptoms immediately

**Watch for:**
- Any headache
- Confusion
- Unusual bruising
- Blood in urine/stool
- Prolonged bleeding from cuts

### If You Have Diabetes
**Slower healing:**
- Check skin breaks daily
- Watch for infection
- Keep wounds clean
- Report non-healing areas

### If You're on Steroids
**Bone fragility and poor healing:**
- Higher fracture risk
- Slower recovery
- More likely to need imaging

## Monitoring Checklist

### Daily for First Week
- □ Pain level (scale 1-10)
- □ Swelling changes
- □ Mobility/function
- □ New symptoms
- □ Appetite and sleep
- □ Mood changes

### When to Escalate Care

**Same day:**
- Significant pain increase
- New neurological symptoms
- Difficulty breathing
- Signs of infection (warmth, redness, fever)

**Within 2-3 days:**
- Not improving as expected
- Can't return to activities
- Persistent pain
- Balance still poor

## Infection Risk

**Skin breaks from fall:**
- Clean wound immediately
- Keep covered
- Watch for redness, warmth, swelling
- Red streaking from wound = emergency
- Fever may indicate infection

**UTI risk (if spent time on floor):**
- Burning with urination
- Urgent, frequent urination
- Confusion (in older adults)

## Deconditioning Risk

**"Post-Fall Syndrome:"**
- Fear leads to reduced activity
- Muscle atrophy from inactivity begins in days
- Further increases fall risk

**Prevention:**
- Return to activities as soon as safe
- Physical therapy if needed
- Address fear through counseling/support
- Don't let one fall stop you from living

## Emotional Recovery

**Normal reactions:**
- Temporary fear
- Hypervigilance
- Replaying the fall
- Worry about recurrence

**Seek help if:**
- Fear paralyzing you
- Avoiding all activities
- Depression
- Social isolation
- Sleep disturbance lasting > 2 weeks
- Panic attacks

## Long-Term Monitoring

**After any fall, track:**
- Near-falls or balance changes
- Medication effects
- Home hazards you've noticed
- Activities you're avoiding

**Share at next doctor visit**

## Cognitive Changes

**Fall + head impact can cause:**
- Memory problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Personality changes
- Confusion

**Don't dismiss as "just aging"—report to doctor**

## Creating a Monitoring Plan

**Before you fall (ideally):**
- Know your baseline
- Understand your medications
- Have doctor's number programmed
- Know when urgent care or ER appropriate

**After falling:**
- Daily symptom checks
- Written log
- Scheduled doctor follow-up
- Support person checking on you

## When Everything Seems Fine

**Still see doctor if:**
- You can't identify what caused fall
- It's your second fall
- You have significant risk factors
- You want fall prevention help

**Don't assume "got lucky this time"—prevent the next one**

## Remember

Your body may not immediately tell you everything that's wrong. Age, medications, and adrenaline can mask symptoms.

When in doubt, get checked out. Better to feel silly for a false alarm than ignore a serious problem.

Most fall complications are treatable if caught early. Delayed treatment makes everything more difficult.

Physical recovery is only part of the picture—address the emotional impact too.

Every fall is a wake-up call. Use it as motivation to implement serious fall prevention

measures.
