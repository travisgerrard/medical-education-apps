# Medicines That Affect Balance

Medications are essential for managing health conditions, but some can increase fall risk. Understanding which medications affect balance helps you work with your doctor to find safer alternatives.

## The Medication-Fall Connection

**Key statistics:**
- Taking **4 or more medications** of any type doubles fall risk
- **47% of older adults** take 5+ medications
- Some medications affect balance even at normal doses

**Important**: Never stop medications on your own. Always consult your healthcare provider.

## High-Risk Medication Categories

### 1. Sedatives and Sleep Medications

**Drug names (examples):**
- Benzodiazepines: diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), alprazolam (Xanax)
- Sleep aids: zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta)
- Older sedatives: diphenhydramine (Benadryl PM)

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Cause drowsiness and confusion
- Slow reaction time
- Affect balance and coordination
- Create "morning hangover" effect
- Increase risk of nighttime falls

**Special concern**: Effects last longer in older adults—a medication taken at bedtime may still affect you the next morning.

### 2. Blood Pressure Medications

**Drug categories:**
- Diuretics ("water pills"): furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide
- Beta-blockers: metoprolol, atenolol
- ACE inhibitors: lisinopril, enalapril
- Calcium channel blockers: amlodipine, diltiazem

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Can drop blood pressure too much
- Cause dizziness when standing (postural hypotension)
- Diuretics increase nighttime bathroom trips
- May cause lightheadedness and weakness

**What to watch for**:
- Feeling dizzy when you stand up
- Vision briefly dims when standing
- Feeling weak or lightheaded

### 3. Antidepressants

**Drug categories:**
- SSRIs: sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa)
- Tricyclics: amitriptyline, nortriptyline
- SNRIs: duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor)

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Cause drowsiness or dizziness
- Affect blood pressure
- Create confusion or unsteadiness
- Interact with other medications

**Note**: Untreated depression also increases fall risk, so don't avoid treatment—work with your doctor for the safest option.

### 4. Opioid Pain Medications

**Drug names:**
- Hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, tramadol, codeine, fentanyl

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Severe drowsiness and confusion
- Slow reflexes dramatically
- Affect judgment
- Cause constipation (leading to straining)
- Build tolerance (need higher doses over time)

**Highest risk**: Combining opioids with benzodiazepines or alcohol

### 5. Anti-Anxiety Medications

**Drug names:**
- Buspirone (BuSpar)
- Benzodiazepines (see sedatives above)
- Hydroxyzine (Vistaril)

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Similar to sedatives
- Reduce alertness
- Impair coordination
- Effects worsen with other medications

### 6. Antihistamines

**Drug names:**
- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
- Hydroxyzine
- Chlorpheniramine
- Found in: cold medicines, sleep aids, allergy pills

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Strong sedative effects
- Dry mouth and blurred vision
- Confusion in older adults
- Often combined with other medications

**Hidden sources**: Check labels on over-the-counter products—many contain these.

### 7. Muscle Relaxants

**Drug names:**
- Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)
- Methocarbamol (Robaxin)
- Carisoprodol (Soma)

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Extreme drowsiness
- Dizziness and weakness
- Poor coordination
- Should be avoided in older adults when possible

### 8. Diabetes Medications

**Drug names:**
- Insulin
- Glyburide, glipizide (sulfonylureas)
- Others: metformin, pioglitazone

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) causes:
  - Weakness and shakiness
  - Confusion
  - Sweating and dizziness
  - Can lead to fainting

**Prevention**: Monitor blood sugar carefully, eat regularly

### 9. Seizure Medications

**Drug names:**
- Phenytoin (Dilantin)
- Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
- Gabapentin (Neurontin)
- Pregabalin (Lyrica)

**How they increase fall risk:**
- Drowsiness and dizziness
- Affect coordination and balance
- Vision changes (double vision)
- Confusion at higher doses

## Polypharmacy (Taking Multiple Medications)

**The problem:**
- Each additional medication increases fall risk
- Medications interact with each other
- Side effects multiply
- Harder to identify which drug causes problems

**Taking 5+ medications**: Risk increases exponentially, not just additively

## Drug Interactions

Dangerous combinations:
- Sedatives + blood pressure medications
- Opioids + benzodiazepines
- Alcohol + any sedating medication
- Multiple drugs with same side effects

## Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications

Don't forget to count:
- Sleep aids
- Cold and allergy medicines
- Pain relievers
- Herbal supplements
- Vitamins

**Many OTC products contain ingredients that increase fall risk**

## What You Can Do

### Medication Review Checklist

**Bring to every doctor appointment:**
- □ All prescription medications
- □ Over-the-counter medications
- □ Vitamins and supplements
- □ Herbal products
- □ Eye drops and topical creams

### Questions to Ask Your Doctor:

1. "Could any of these medications increase my fall risk?"
2. "Are there safer alternatives?"
3. "Can we reduce doses or eliminate any?"
4. "What's the best time to take each medication?"
5. "What should I do if I feel dizzy or unsteady?"

### Medication Safety Tips

**Timing:**
- Take sedating medications at bedtime only
- Avoid morning doses of drowsy-causing drugs
- Space medications to reduce interaction

**Monitoring:**
- Stand up slowly after taking blood pressure meds
- Check blood sugar if on diabetes medications
- Report any new dizziness or imbalance

**Organization:**
- Use pill organizers
- Keep updated medication list
- Set reminders for doses
- Dispose of old medications

### When to Call Your Doctor

Contact your healthcare provider if you experience:
- New dizziness or lightheadedness

## Safer Alternatives

### Instead of sleeping pills:
- Sleep hygiene improvements
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Melatonin (discuss with doctor)

- Non-medication anxiety treatments
- Exercise
- Therapy
- Safer anti-anxiety medications

### Instead of strong pain medications:
- Physical therapy

## Pharmacist as a Resource

Your pharmacist can:
- Review all medications for interactions
- Explain side effects
- Suggest timing strategies
- Communicate with your doctor
- Provide medication counseling

**Free service**: Most insurance covers medication therapy management.

## Remember

Medications save lives and manage conditions effectively. The goal isn't to avoid all medications—it's to use the safest options at the lowest effective doses. Work closely with your healthcare team to balance benefits and fall risks.
