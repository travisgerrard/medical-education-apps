# Goals of Care

Recovery doesn't always mean "curing" anxiety or depression completely. It's about reducing symptoms, improving your quality of life, and getting back to the things that matter to you.

## What Recovery Looks Like
- **Symptom Reduction**: Feeling less sad, anxious, or worried.
- **Improved Functioning**: Being able to work, socialize, and enjoy hobbies again.
- **Prevention**: Learning skills to prevent future episodes.

## Your Role
- **Be Open**: Share your feelings and symptoms with your care team.
- **Be Patient**: Treatment takes time. It may take a few weeks to feel the full benefits of medication or therapy.
- **Stay Committed**: Stick to your treatment plan, even when you start feeling better.
