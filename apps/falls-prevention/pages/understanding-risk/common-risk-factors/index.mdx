# Common Risk Factors

Certain characteristics and conditions increase your likelihood of falling. Recognizing these helps you take preventive action.

## Physical Risk Factors

### Muscle Weakness
**Signs:**
- Difficulty getting up from a chair without using your arms
- Needing to hold onto walls or furniture when walking
- Feeling your legs "give out"

**Why it matters**: Weak leg muscles can't catch you when you stumble. Reduced strength in hips, knees, and ankles directly increases fall risk.

### Balance Problems
**Signs:**
- Feeling unsteady when standing still
- Difficulty walking in a straight line
- Needing to look down at your feet constantly
- Swaying or grabbing for support

**Why it matters**: Good balance requires coordination between your eyes, inner ear, muscles, and brain. Problems with any of these systems affect stability.

### Gait Changes
**Warning signs:**
- Taking small, shuffling steps
- Walking slowly or hesitantly
- Difficulty turning or changing direction
- Asymmetric walking pattern

## Sensory Risk Factors

### Vision Problems
**Common issues:**
- Cataracts or glaucoma
- Poor depth perception
- Difficulty adjusting to light changes
- Uncorrected nearsightedness or farsightedness
- Bifocals (can distort distance perception on stairs)

**Statistics**: People with vision problems are **approximately 2x more likely** to fall than those with good vision (research shows 1.7-2x increased risk).

### Hearing Loss
**Why it affects falls**: Your inner ear helps control balance. Hearing loss may indicate balance system problems and also reduces environmental awareness.

### Foot Problems
- Numbness or tingling (peripheral neuropathy)
- Pain when walking
- Bunions or hammertoes
- Thick toenails or calluses
- Loss of sensation (can't feel the ground)

## Previous Falls

**Critical fact**: If you've fallen once, your chance of falling again **doubles**.

Why this happens:
- Fear of falling reduces activity
- Reduced activity weakens muscles
- Weaker muscles increase fall risk
- The cycle continues

## Chronic Conditions

Several health conditions increase risk:
- Arthritis (joint pain affects movement)
- Diabetes (can cause nerve damage and vision problems)
- Parkinson's disease (affects gait and balance)
- Stroke (may cause weakness or balance problems)
- Heart disease or irregular heartbeat
- Osteoporosis (doesn't cause falls but increases fracture risk)

## Medications

Taking **4 or more medications** significantly increases fall risk, regardless of type. High-risk medications include:
- Blood pressure medicines
- Sleep medications
- Anti-anxiety drugs
- Antidepressants
- Pain medications

## Other Risk Factors

### Urinary Urgency
- Rushing to the bathroom, especially at night
- Incontinence concerns
- Frequent nighttime urination

### Footwear
- Wearing only socks or slippers
- Loose-fitting shoes
- High heels or shoes with slick soles

### Fear of Falling
- Becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
- Causes you to limit activities
- Leads to weakness and isolation

## How Many Risk Factors Do You Have?

**0-1 factors**: Low risk (maintain current health)
**2-3 factors**: Moderate risk (implement prevention strategies)
**4+ factors**: High risk (consult healthcare provider for comprehensive assessment)

## What You Can Do

- Be honest about which factors apply to you
- Discuss risk factors with your doctor
- Start with the most modifiable factors
- Don't let multiple risks overwhelm you—address them one at a time

## Remember

Identifying risk factors isn't about blame or fear. It's about understanding where to focus your prevention efforts for maximum benefit.
