# Common Risk Factors

You may be more likely to fall if you:
- Have weak leg muscles
- Feel unsteady or need to hold furniture
- Have fallen before
- Have numbness in your feet
- Have vision problems
- Rush to the bathroom often
- Wear shoes that do not fit well

These are common and can often be improved.
