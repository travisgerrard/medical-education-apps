# Other Medication Options

If SSRIs and SNRIs don't work for you, or if the side effects are too difficult, there are many other effective options. About 30-40% of people don't respond fully to the first medication they try, so having alternatives is important.

## Atypical Antidepressants

These medications work differently than SSRIs/SNRIs and often have different side effect profiles.

### Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
**How it works**: Increases dopamine and norepinephrine (no effect on serotonin).
**Best for**:
- People with **fatigue** or low energy (it's activating)
- People concerned about **sexual side effects** (it rarely causes them)
- People who want to **quit smoking** (it reduces cravings)
**Downsides**: Can increase anxiety in some people; not for those with seizure disorders or eating disorders.

### Mirtazapine (Remeron)
**How it works**: Increases serotonin and norepinephrine release.
**Best for**:
- People with **insomnia** (it is very sedating at lower doses)
- People with **poor appetite** or weight loss (it increases appetite)
- Older adults
**Downsides**: Can cause significant weight gain and drowsiness.

### Trazodone
**How it works**: Modulates serotonin.
**Best for**:
- Primarily used as a **sleep aid** for people with depression/anxiety (taken at night).
- Rarely used alone for depression because high doses are needed, which cause too much drowsiness.

## Older Classes of Antidepressants

These are effective but generally have more side effects. They are often used when newer drugs haven't worked ("treatment-resistant depression").

### Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)
*Examples: Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline, Imipramine*
- **Pros**: Very effective for severe depression and chronic pain.
- **Cons**: Can cause dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, and dizziness. dangerous in overdose.

### MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)
*Examples: Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine*
- **Pros**: Can work when nothing else does.
- **Cons**: Require a strict diet (avoiding tyramine-rich foods like aged cheese/wine) to prevent dangerous blood pressure spikes.

## Medications for Anxiety Relief

### Benzodiazepines
*Examples: Alprazolam (Xanax), Lorazepam (Ativan), Clonazepam (Klonopin)*
- **Use**: Short-term relief of severe anxiety or panic attacks.
- **Pros**: Work very quickly (within minutes).
- **Cons**: **High risk of dependence and addiction**. Tolerance builds quickly (you need more to get the same effect). Not for long-term use.

### Buspirone (Buspar)
- **Use**: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
- **Pros**: Non-addictive, doesn't cause sedation.
- **Cons**: Takes weeks to work (like an antidepressant); doesn't help with panic attacks.

### Beta-Blockers
*Examples: Propranolol*
- **Use**: Performance anxiety (stage fright).
- **Pros**: Blocks physical symptoms of anxiety (racing heart, shaking) without affecting your mind.
- **Cons**: Doesn't stop anxious thoughts, just physical reactions.

## Newer & Interventional Treatments

For depression that hasn't responded to standard medications ("Treatment-Resistant Depression"):

### Esketamine (Spravato)
- **What it is**: A nasal spray derived from ketamine.
- **Use**: For treatment-resistant depression or suicidal thinking.
- **How it works**: Acts on glutamate (a different brain chemical). rapid onset (hours to days).
- **Note**: Must be administered in a certified clinic.

### TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)
- **What it is**: Non-invasive magnetic pulses stimulate nerve cells in the brain.
- **Use**: Depression that hasn't responded to meds.
- **Pros**: No medication side effects.
