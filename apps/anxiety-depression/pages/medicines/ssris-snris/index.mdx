# SSRIs and SNRIs: First-Line Medications

SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) are the most commonly prescribed medications for depression and anxiety. They're recommended as first-line treatment by major clinical guidelines because they're effective and generally well-tolerated.[^1][^2]

## What Are SSRIs?

**SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)** work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, sleep, appetite, and anxiety.

### How They Work

Normally, serotonin is released between brain cells (neurons), delivers its message, and then gets reabsorbed (reuptaken). SSRIs **block this reabsorption**, leaving more serotonin available in the space between neurons. Over time, this helps improve mood and reduce anxiety.

### Common SSRIs

| Medication | Brand Name | Typical Dose | Notes |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Fluoxetine** | Prozac | 20-80 mg/day | Long half-life (stays in system longer) |
| **Sertraline** | Zoloft | 50-200 mg/day | Often first choice; treats depression & anxiety |
| **Escitalopram** | Lexapro | 10-20 mg/day | Well-tolerated, fewer side effects |
| **Citalopram** | Celexa | 20-40 mg/day | Similar to Lexapro but older |
| **Paroxetine** | Paxil | 20-60 mg/day | More sedating; can be harder to stop |
| **Fluvoxamine** | Luvox | 100-300 mg/day | Often used for OCD |

### What SSRIs Treat

- **Depression** (major depressive disorder)
- **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**
- **Panic disorder**
- **Social anxiety disorder**
- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**
- **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**

## What Are SNRIs?

**SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)** increase both serotonin *and* norepinephrine in the brain. Norepinephrine affects alertness, energy, and attention.

### How They Work

Like SSRIs, SNRIs block reabsorption—but they block reuptake of *two* neurotransmitters instead of one.

### Common SNRIs

| Medication | Brand Name | Typical Dose | Notes |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Venlafaxine** | Effexor XR | 75-225 mg/day | Effective for depression & anxiety |
| **Duloxetine** | Cymbalta | 30-120 mg/day | Also treats chronic pain (fibromyalgia, neuropathy) |
| **Desvenlafaxine** | Pristiq | 50-100 mg/day | Similar to venlafaxine |
| **Levomilnacipran** | Fetzima | 40-120 mg/day | Newer, less commonly used |

### What SNRIs Treat

- **Depression**
- **Generalized anxiety disorder**
- **Panic disorder**
- **Social anxiety**
- **Chronic pain conditions** (especially duloxetine)

## SSRIs vs. SNRIs: How They Compare

|  | SSRIs | SNRIs |
|--|-------|-------|
| **Effectiveness** | Equally effective for depression/anxiety[^3] | Equally effective for depression/anxiety |
| **Side effects** | Generally fewer | Slightly more (especially at higher doses) |
| **Energy** | Can help with energy or cause fatigue (varies) | May provide more energy due to norepinephrine boost |
| **Pain** | No direct effect on pain | Duloxetine is FDA-approved for chronic pain |
| **Blood pressure** | No effect | Can increase blood pressure (monitor if you have hypertension) |

**Bottom line**: For most people, SSRIs and SNRIs work equally well. The "best" one is whichever you tolerate with the fewest side effects.

## What to Expect When Starting

### Timeline for Improvement

- **Weeks 1-2**: Side effects (if any) are strongest. Mood likely hasn't improved yet.
- **Weeks 2-4**: Side effects usually decrease. You may start to notice **small improvements** (sleeping better, slightly more energy).
- **Weeks 4-8**: Most people see **meaningful improvement** in mood and anxiety.
- **Weeks 8-12**: Full therapeutic effect. If you're not better by 12 weeks, your doctor may adjust the dose or try a different medication.

**Key point**: **These medications take time to work**. Don't expect to feel better in a week. Be patient.

### Common Side Effects

**Most common (and usually temporary)**:
- Nausea or upset stomach
- Headache
- Fatigue or drowsiness
- Insomnia or vivid dreams
- Dry mouth
- Increased sweating

**These usually go away after 1-2 weeks.**

**Sexual side effects** (more persistent):
- Decreased libido (sex drive)
- Difficulty reaching orgasm
- Erectile dysfunction (in men)

**These affect 30-50% of people** and may not go away. Talk to your doctor if this is a problem—switching medications or adding another drug can help.

**Less common but important**:
- Weight gain (more common with paroxetine and mirtazapine)
- Emotional blunting (feeling "numb" or less reactive)
- Increased anxiety or agitation (especially in the first few weeks)

### What If Side Effects Are Unbearable?

**Don't just stop taking the medication**—withdrawal symptoms can be uncomfortable. Instead:
1. Call your doctor
2. They may lower the dose, switch you to a different medication, or help you taper off slowly

## How to Choose Between SSRIs and SNRIs

### Start with an SSRI If:
- You have **no history** of trying antidepressants
- You want the **fewest side effects**
- You have **anxiety as the primary symptom**

**Most common first choices**: Sertraline (Zoloft) or escitalopram (Lexapro)

### Consider an SNRI If:
- You've tried SSRIs and they didn't work
- You have **chronic pain** (fibromyalgia, neuropathy) along with depression
- You have **fatigue and low energy** as major symptoms

**Most common choice**: Duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor)

## Evidence: Do They Work?

**Yes**. Large studies show:
- SSRIs and SNRIs are **significantly more effective than placebo** (sugar pill) for depression and anxiety[^3]
- About **60-70% of people improve** with the first medication they try
- If the first one doesn't work, trying a second or third often does

A 2018 network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants found **all modern antidepressants more effective than placebo**, with similar efficacy between agents.[^3] The key is finding the one that works for *you* with tolerable side effects.

## Important Safety Information

### Black Box Warning (Suicidal Thoughts in Young People)

The FDA requires a warning that antidepressants may **increase suicidal thoughts in people under 25**, especially in the first few weeks of treatment.

**What you should know**:
- The risk is **small** (about 2-4% vs. 1-2% with placebo)
- Untreated depression carries a **much higher risk of suicide**
- Close monitoring in the first few weeks is important
- Tell your doctor immediately if you have new or worsening suicidal thoughts

### Serotonin Syndrome (Rare but Serious)

If you take multiple medications that increase serotonin (e.g., SSRI + tramadol + triptans for migraines), you can develop **serotonin syndrome**:
- Symptoms: agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high fever, muscle rigidity, seizures
- **This is a medical emergency**—go to the ER

**Prevention**: Always tell your doctor about *all* medications you're taking.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

SSRIs/SNRIs can be used during pregnancy if needed, but discuss risks and benefits with your doctor. Untreated depression also poses risks to pregnancy.

**Generally considered safer**: Sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac) during pregnancy.

## Stopping SSRIs/SNRIs

**Never stop suddenly**—you can have withdrawal symptoms (dizziness, nausea, "brain zaps," irritability).

**How to stop safely**:
- Taper gradually over weeks to months with your doctor's guidance
- Medications with short half-lives (paroxtine, venlafaxine) are harder to stop—taper very slowly

## The Bottom Line

SSRIs and SNRIs are safe, effective, first-line treatments for depression and anxiety. They take 4-8 weeks to work fully, and side effects usually improve after the first 1-2 weeks.

**All of these medications are equally effective for most people**. The "best" one is the one that works for *you* with the fewest side effects.
