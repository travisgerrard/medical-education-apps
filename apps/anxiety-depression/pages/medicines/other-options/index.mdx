# Other Options and When They Are Used

If SSRIs and SNRIs don't work or cause too many side effects, there are other options.

## Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
- Works on dopamine and norepinephrine
- Good option if you have fatigue or don't want sexual side effects
- May also help with quitting smoking

## Mirtazapine (Remeron)
- Helps with sleep and appetite
- Good for people who have insomnia or weight loss

## Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)
- Older medications (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline)
- Effective but more side effects
- Sometimes used when other medications haven't worked

## Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax, Ativan)
- Work quickly for acute anxiety
- Not recommended for long-term use due to risk of dependence
- May be used short-term during a crisis

> [!WARNING]
> Benzodiazepines should be used cautiously and only for short periods. They can be habit-forming.
