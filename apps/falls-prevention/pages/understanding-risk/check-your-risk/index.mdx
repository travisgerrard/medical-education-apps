# How to Check Your Own Risk

You can assess many fall risk factors on your own. These simple self-tests help you understand your current risk level and decide when to seek professional help.

## Before You Start

**Safety first:**
- Perform these tests with someone nearby
- Do them near a sturdy chair or counter for support
- Stop immediately if you feel unsafe
- Skip any test if you've recently fallen or feel very unsteady

**These tests don't replace** professional medical evaluation—they supplement it.

## Balance Self-Tests

### 1. One-Leg Stand Test

**What it tests**: Balance and leg strength

**How to do it:**
1. Stand near a counter (don't hold on unless needed)
2. Lift one foot about 6 inches off the ground
3. Time how long you can hold this position
4. Repeat with other leg

**Results:**
- **< 5 seconds**: High fall risk—see your doctor
- **5-10 seconds**: Moderate risk—work on balance exercises
- **> 10 seconds**: Good balance for age

### 2. Tandem Stand Test

**What it tests**: Balance control

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with one foot directly in front of the other (heel touching toes)
2. Hold position for 10 seconds
3. Try with eyes open, then eyes closed (if able)

**Results:**
- **Can't hold 10 seconds**: Balance issues—discuss with doctor
- **Can hold 10+ seconds, eyes open**: Adequate balance
- **Can hold with eyes closed**: Excellent balance

### 3. Reaching Test

**What it tests**: Balance while moving

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with arm raised to shoulder height
2. Reach forward as far as possible without

 stepping
3. Measure distance reached (have someone help)

**Results:**
- **< 7 inches**: High fall risk
- **7-10 inches**: Moderate risk
- **> 10 inches**: Lower risk

## Strength Self-Tests

### 4. Sit-to-Stand Test

**What it tests**: Leg strength needed for daily activities

**How to do it:**
1. Sit in an armless chair (seat height ~17 inches)
2. Cross arms over chest
3. Stand up completely, then sit back down
4. Repeat 5 times as quickly as possible
5. Time yourself

**Results for ages 65-69:**
- **< 11 seconds**: Excellent
- **11-13 seconds**: Good
- **14-16 seconds**: Average
- **> 16 seconds**: Below average—consider strength training

### 5. Chair Stand Test (Alternative)

**Simpler version:**
- Can you stand from a chair **without using your hands**?
- **Yes comfortably**: Good strength
- **Barely or can't do it**: Muscle weakness—needs attention

## Walking and Gait Self-Tests

### 6. Timed Up and Go (TUG)

**What it tests**: Overall mobility and fall risk

**Setup needed:**
- A chair with arms
- Mark a line 10 feet away
- Timer

**How to do it:**
1. Sit in the chair
2. On "go," stand up
3. Walk to the line (normal pace)
4. Turn around
5. Walk back and sit down
6. Time the entire sequence

**Results:**
- **< 10 seconds**: Low fall risk
- **10-12 seconds**: Moderate risk
- **> 12 seconds**: High risk—see your doctor
- **> 20 seconds**: Very high risk—immediate professional evaluation needed

### 7. Walking Speed Test

**What it tests**: Functional mobility

**How to do it:**
1. Mark a 10-foot walking path
2. Walk at your normal pace
3. Time how long it takes

**Results:**
- **< 4 seconds** (2.5+ ft/sec): Normal
- **4-6 seconds** (1.5-2.5 ft/sec): Mild impairment
- **> 6 seconds** (< 1.5 ft/sec): Significant impairment

## Vision Self-Checks

### 8. Vision Awareness

Ask yourself:
- □ Do I have trouble seeing in dim light?
- □ Are stairs difficult to navigate?
- □ Do I bump into objects?
- □ Is reading harder than before?
- □ Do I have trouble judging distances?
- □ Has it been > 1 year since eye exam?

**Any "yes" answers**: Schedule eye examination

## Environmental Risk Assessment

### 9. Home Safety Walk-Through

Go through each room and check:

**Floors:**
- □ Any throw rugs?
- □ Clutter or obstacles?
- □ Slippery surfaces?
- □ Worn carpet or uneven flooring?

**Lighting:**
- □ Can you turn on lights before entering rooms?
- □ Are hallways and stairs well-lit?
- □ Do you have nightlights?

**Stairs:**
- □ Do all stairs have handrails?
- □ Are step edges visible?
- □ Any loose carpeting?

**Bathroom:**
- □ Grab bars near toilet and tub?
- □ Non-slip mat in tub/shower?
- □ Can you get in/out of tub safely?

## Medical Risk Factors Checklist

### 10. Personal Risk Factor Count

Count how many apply to you:
- □ Previous fall in past year
- □ Feel unsteady when walking
- □ Worry about falling
- □ Dizzy or lightheaded sometimes
- □ Numbness in feet
- □ Take 4+ medications
- □ Take medications for sleep, anxiety, or depression
- □ Have had medication changes recently
- □ Arthritis, Parkinson's, or stroke
- □ Limit activities due to fear of falling

**Score:**
- **0-2**: Low risk—maintain current efforts
- **3-4**: Moderate risk—implement prevention strategies
- **5+**: High risk—discuss with doctor

## When to Seek Professional Evaluation

**Schedule appointment if:**
- You failed any balance or strength test
- TUG test took > 12 seconds
- You have 3+ risk factors
- You've fallen in the past year
- You feel unsafe or unsteady

**Seek immediate care if:**
- You're having frequent near-falls
- You've fallen multiple times
- You feel extremely unsteady
- You experience sudden balance changes

## Tracking Your Progress

**Retest every 3 months to monitor:**
- Improvement from exercises
- Decline needing intervention
- Effects of new medications or conditions

**Keep a record:**
- Date of test
- Results
- How you felt
- Any concerns

## What the Results Mean

### Understanding Your Risk Level

**Low Risk (passed most tests):**
- Continue current active lifestyle
- Maintain home safety
- Stay vigilant for changes

**Moderate Risk (some test failures):**
- Start balance and strength exercises
- Make home modifications
- Review medications with doctor
- Increase awareness

**High Risk (failed multiple tests):**
- See doctor for comprehensive evaluation
- Consider physical therapy
- Make immediate home safety changes
- May need assistive devices

## Next Steps Based on Results

**If tests show balance problems:**
- Begin balance exercises (see later sections)
- Consider Tai Chi or similar programs
- Ask doctor about vestibular testing

**If tests show weakness:**
- Start strength training exercises
- Ensure adequate protein intake
- May need physical therapy assessment

**If tests show slow gait:**
- Assess for pain or joint problems
- Check if assistive device needed
- Consider podiatry evaluation

## Remember

Self-assessment is empowering—it gives you concrete information about your fall risk. But it's just the beginning. Use these results to guide conversations with your healthcare team and motivate your fall prevention efforts.

These simple tests can be life-saving when they identify problems early enough to address them.
