# Worry Management and Thought Reframing

Anxiety often feels like a broken record in your brain—playing the same scary thoughts over and over. You can't just "stop worrying," but you can change how you respond to those thoughts.

## Productive vs. Unproductive Worry

Not all worry is bad.
- **Productive Worry**: Leads to action. "I'm worried about the test, so I'll study."
- **Unproductive Worry**: "What if" loops with no solution. "What if I fail? What if everyone laughs?"

**The Goal**: Turn productive worry into a plan, and learn to let go of unproductive worry.

## Technique 1: Scheduled Worry Time

This sounds counterintuitive, but it works.
1.  **Pick a time**: Set aside 15-20 minutes every day (e.g., 4:30 PM).
2.  **Postpone**: When a worry pops up during the day, say, "Not now. I'll worry about this at 4:30." Write it down if you need to.
3.  **Worry**: During your scheduled time, go through your list. Worry as much as you want.
4.  **Stop**: When the timer goes off, stop. Go do something else.

**Why it works**: It breaks the habit of constant, low-level worrying throughout the day.

## Technique 2: Catching "Thinking Traps"

Anxious brains fall into predictable patterns (cognitive distortions). Recognizing them is the first step to stopping them.

### Common Traps
- **Catastrophizing**: Jumping to the worst-case scenario. ("If I make a mistake, I'll get fired and lose my house.")
- **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: Seeing things as perfect or terrible. ("If I'm not the best, I'm a failure.")
- **Mind Reading**: Assuming you know what others are thinking. ("They all think I'm boring.")
- **Emotional Reasoning**: Believing that because you *feel* scared, you *are* in danger.

## Technique 3: The 3 C's of Reframing

When you catch a negative thought, challenge it using the 3 C's:

### 1. Catch It
Identify the thought. "I'm thinking that I'm going to fail this presentation."

### 2. Check It
Look at the evidence. Be a detective, not a judge.
- **Evidence for**: "I stumbled over my words once in practice."
- **Evidence against**: "I've prepared for weeks. I know the material. I've done good presentations before."

### 3. Change It
Create a more balanced, realistic thought.
- **Old thought**: "I'm going to fail and everyone will laugh."
- **New thought**: "I might be nervous, but I'm prepared. Even if I stumble, it won't be a disaster."

## Technique 4: The "Best, Worst, Likely" Scenario

When you're stuck on a "What if," play it out:
1.  **What's the worst that could happen?** (Be specific. "I trip and fall.")
2.  **What's the best that could happen?** ("I get a standing ovation.")
3.  **What's most likely to happen?** ("It goes okay. Maybe a few awkward moments, but mostly fine.")

## When Thoughts Won't Stop

Sometimes, fighting thoughts makes them stronger. In those moments, try **mindfulness**:
- Imagine your thoughts are cars driving by on a street.
- You are sitting on the sidewalk watching them.
- You don't have to run into traffic and stop the cars. Just let them drive by.
