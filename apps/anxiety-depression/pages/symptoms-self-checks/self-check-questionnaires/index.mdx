# Self Check Questionnaires

Clinicians use standardized, validated tools to screen for anxiety and depression and track your progress over time.

## PHQ-9 (Depression)
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a validated 9-item questionnaire that asks about the frequency of depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks.[^1]

**Scores**:
- **5-9**: Mild depression
- **10-14**: Moderate depression
- **15-19**: Moderately severe depression
- **20+**: Severe depression

## GAD-7 (Anxiety)
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) is a validated 7-item scale that measures anxiety symptoms over the last 2 weeks.[^2]

**Scores**:
- **5-9**: Mild anxiety
- **10-14**: Moderate anxiety
- **15+**: Severe anxiety

## What Scores Mean
These scores help your care team:
- Understand the severity of your symptoms
- Decide on the best treatment approach
- Measure improvement over time (measurement-based care)
- Adjust treatment if needed

The USPSTF recommends screening all adults for depression, including pregnant and postpartum individuals.[^3]
